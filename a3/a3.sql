There would not have been a moon landing without Kennedy, even though he was cruelly prevented from living long enough to see it.

The Berlin airlift was a perfect example of this.  Kennedy did the right thing.  This was morally courageous of him, as well.  Let us not forget, he was a veteran of WW II who could nonetheless say \"Ich bin ein Berliner\".  I also don\'t think that the price controls on the steel industry are a significant issue to bring up 50 years after Kennedy\'s assassination.  The US economy did extremely well at that time period, and only started to get seriously into trouble decades later, and for reasons having nothing to do with Kennedy\'s use of price controls.

First off, \"agenda\" is a broad term - and can be applied to many things together or one thing in particular.  Thus, I would only have to prove that one thing did outlive him and the general purpose of this argument would be broken.\n\n>On May 25, 1961, President John F. Kennedy announced before a special joint session of Congress the dramatic and ambitious goal of sending an American safely to the Moon before the end of the decade.\n\nWhile the space race was started before JFK started office, the US was getting destroyed by the Russians, badly.  To not only beat the Russians, but in a span of less than 9 years?  People thought it was impossible.  There was much that was going against the program.  There were deaths, failures, and large....large bills.  \n\nIt is something that is politically toxic in this day and age.  Not a single president has had as much success with the space program.  They make plans 15 years down the line, which quickly get gutted either a few months later or by the next president, who then makes his own 15 year program - which will also amount to much of nothing.\n\nYet Kennedy did it.  He created a legacy, an agenda, that outlived him.  It was carried on by his VP, who kept the program alive after it became largely unfavorable after Apollo 1, and then to a Republican who hated most of the things Kennedy had done.  Yet Nixon still kept the Apollo program, though by that time it had a very high likelihood of success.  Kennedy was quite popular, and he would have easily secured a second term, which would have brought him to 1969 - even had Nixon still won the following election, the Apollo program was already in a position to succeed by the end of the decade, and Nixon wouldn\'t have killed it.  But Kennedy was killed, and for 9 years, congress wanted to take a knife to NASA and use the remains of its budget for their special interests, but they couldn\'t.  Because of Kennedy, NASA was politically untouchable until 1970.  How is this ineffectual at getting an agenda passed through congress?  It outlived him, 2 presidents, and 5 sessions of congress.  And even after that, we have NASA strong and alive, and as one of our main programs of peace with the Russians and other nations.  The space race was a success, and it was all thanks to JFK who got the program really moving.\n\nAnd yet this has caused secondary and tertiary benefits for the US.  Because of the surge of space technology and usage, which the US shared with its allies, all of the NATO countries had a huge boom in communication, technology, and planetary sciences such as meteorology.  Then there\'s the hidden aspect to the Cold War - a rocket that can easily and accurately land someone on the moon can be a missile that accurately drops a bomb on a target.  By the end of the space race, the US had far better ICBMs than their friends on the other side of the North Pole, thus making the very minor strategic loss of missiles in Turkey all the more hollow.  \n\nBecause of Kennedy, humanity has reached the moon and beyond.  [His speech at Rice University, in Texas, still echoes in history](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouRbkBAOGEw).  His words [\"We choose to go to the moon...\"](http://youtu.be/ouRbkBAOGEw?t=8m23s) still are regarded as some of the most inspirational any president has ever spoken, and it\'s ingrained the pride of NASA into every single American.  His forceful push still breathes life into the United States\' space program.  It\'s called Kennedy Space Center for a good, real reason.  His legacy is space, and it has endured long after him.\n','1r7uek',2,0,9,6,NULL,0,0),(1,1385135718,'cdki4fn','audacias','r/changemyview',0,'I feel that his early death certainly solidified our memory of him at his prime, and national sentiment for a dead leader would cause grief and reminiscence at his loss, especially for a President as popular as Kennedy (his approval rating was through the roof at the time). \n\nI disagree that he\'s considered a great president only because he was assassinated. His decisions, which were at some times made against the will of his advisers, may have avoided a nuclear Third World War. His motions on Civil Rights were, especially for the time, momentous and progressive, even more so than our current President stating he supports gay rights.\n\nOf course we have deified him since his death, and overlook any of his flaws in favour of his taintless memory, as we tend to do with the dead who we love. We want him to be a perfect President because we want to honour him. So we do avoid the fact that he wasn\'t perfect - things in Vietnam were not going well at all, he had trouble getting some things passed, and the Bay of Pigs... well, we all know how that went. \n\nIt is, though, impossible to say how he would have turned out after a full term or two.

In addition, the economy was healthy and growing during much of his presidency (and time following). Regardless of whether this was directly due to his policy initiatives or not, much of the credit would have made it his way--regardless of whether his term was cut short. Your text seems to indicate you don\'t believe he\'d have been able to get such laws passed, but all evidence points to the fact that they were popular enough to have made it through with a little more time.\n* Steel industry is a can of worms, but I think popular opinion outside the steel industry sided with JFK at the time and would have continued to do so, but there\'s really very little direct evidence that we can use to speculate about what might have happened. The industry was not a popular one at the time and there was solid evidence of price fixing. An overzealous attack like the one executed by the JFK administration is extremely high risk in the short term, but it was met with reasonably positive reactions from the public.\n* JFK\'s stance on Civil Rights is an interesting subject. I think he employed enough rhetoric combined with enough inaction to pave the way for the next guy to do his job, while not tanking his own career. He did pass measures that banned discrimination in public housing, as well as for government jobs and gov contractors. He created the CEEO, launched the Voter Education project, and dedicated legal resources to expanding voting rights. The CEEO, at his prompting, generated the Plan for Progress which seemed to catch on broadly and have reasonable success.\n* SPACE! He was successful in getting money and passion in line for getting humans to explore beyond Earth!\n\n\n\nThere\'s an interesting comment on the New Frontier Wiki page (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Frontier), which is an interesting page in its own right.\n\n>According to Theodore White, under John F. Kennedy, more new legislation was actually approved and passed into law than at any other time since the Thirties.[9] When Congress recessed in the latter part of 1961, 33 out of 53 bills that Kennedy had submitted to Congress were enacted. A year later, 40 out of 54 bills that the Kennedy Administration had proposed were passed by Congress, and in 1963 35 out of 58 “must” bills were enacted. As noted by Larry O’Brien, \"A myth had arisen that he [Kennedy] was uninterested in Congress, or that he “failed” with Congress. The facts, I believe, are otherwise. Kennedy’s legislative record in 1961–63 was the best of any President since Roosevelt’s first term\".[10] \n\n\nJFK was certainly not a perfect president, but he was effective and popular at the time. We may speculate that the popularity would have dropped off some over time, but I see very little in his record that indicates that would be the case. \n\nEDIT: Bay of Pigs I think worked out for him well due to honesty, and because people liked to see he was doing *something*.

The Bay of Pigs was a plan that the Eisenhower administration had established. It was brought to the new Commander in Chief by a enthusiastic military and CIA leadership that failed to accurately explain the risks associated with the plan. Several reports at the time [identified the CIA as responsible for the plans failure](http://www2.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB355/). You can blame President Kennedy for his naivete in allowing the CIA plan to move forward without properly questioning the plan, but I would argue that such a criticism is misplaced. A president can only succeed when he allows his subject matter experts to do their jobs and makes decisions based on their suggestions. In this case, they misled and improperly advised the president. While we live in a \"The Buck Stops Here\" leadership society, recognizing the factors that went into his decision are crucial to understanding the choices he made and assigning blame.\n\nThere are almost no historians who blame President Kennedy\'s handling of the Cuban Missile Crisis. I have no idea where you are coming from when you suggest he bungled the situation. As the Soviets attempted to place nuclear missiles 80 miles off the coast of the United States, President Kennedy averted nuclear war through calm, reasoned discussions with Premier Khrushchev. I have no idea what possible alternative you are suggesting would be preferable to the manner in which President Kennedy handled it.\n\nPresident Kennedy not only vocally supported Civil Rights, but acted on Civil Rights. President Kennedy had the Attorney General, Bobby Kennedy, assign Federal Marshals to protect the Freedom Riders when local law enforcement and regional FBI agents failed to protect them. Executive Order 10925 made it impermissible for federal hiring practices to discriminate based on race, color, or national origin. Federal Order 11063 extended those protections to federal housing. The administration sent 3,000 troops to Ole Miss to protect James Meredith when he enrolled in school there and federalized the Alabama National Guard to ensure Governor Wallace couldn\'t deny two black students entry into the University of Alabama. The president ordered thousands of troops to protect the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom after threats were made, and invited leaders for a photo-op at the White House afterwards to demonstrate his support. The president\'s legislative proposals continued to be thwarted by southern segregationists, but shortly before his assassination, President Kennedy was able to see his bill get out of committee due to his personal pleas at a White House meeting. President Kennedy operated within the realms of executive power as aggressively on Civil Rights as he could and pushed legislative leaders to the detriment of some of his other domestic agenda. Had President Kennedy known he would be assassinated on November 22, 1963, I imagine he would have fought harder to ensure a legacy of commitment to Civil Rights, but he didn\'t and instead focused on a long-term struggle against segregationists for a better plan rather than a battered and bruised civil rights bill immediately.\n\nI think your criticism of President Kennedy\'s efforts against an intransigent, colluding steel industry are off-base. In the midst of a growing middle class boom and the accompanying rise in home ownership, there was a real risk of rising inflation that could have stymied all the progress the US had seen since 1945. After an agreement was made between the steel industry and labor to prevent inflationary price rises, the steel industry collectively decided to increase costs to maximize profits to the detriment of the economy and the dollar. Rather than allowing the collusion of big steel to record huge profits and increase inflation, President Kennedy asserted the Justice Department\'s right to intervene in collusion and ordered the Defense Department to shift contracts away from the violators of the previous agreement. Under pressure, the steel industry reverted back to market prices as they stood. While some numbers indicate the market could have benefited from the increased profits that steel industry would have reaped, the secondary costs for citizens and the impact of inflation could have arguably counteracted those estimates. In the end, I think the president supported the millions of people who had the most to lose over the industries who were only looking for profits and he made the right decision.\n\nBeyond your criticisms, I think it is important to note some of President Kennedy\'s other accomplishments: the creation of the Peace Corps, which has seen over 210,000 Americans serve in 139 countries. The Limited Test Ban Treaty, which limited all above ground nuclear tests. Pushed the American space program into a competitive mode that allowed the United States to land a man on the moon within the time-frame President Kennedy established. Established Special Forces command.\n\nPresident Kennedy didn\'t accomplish everything he set out to do, but you cannot judge a man by what he planned to do but was never given a chance to finish. His legacy, correctly, includes some of the accomplishments of his predecessor, who often invoked President Kennedy\'s memory as a catalyst for change and progress. President Kennedy\'s ideas for medicare, Civil Rights, federal education aid, rural development aid, tax reform were accomplished quickly under President Johnson in large part to honor President Kennedy\'s legacy. He was a transcendent figure in American politics, strove the make the world a better place, and never got the chance to finish what he started. His assassination limited his accomplishments, but not his impact. I think your criticisms should be seen through a broader scope in order to appreciate his impact.\n\nTLDR: I disagree with the criticisms, think the critique is purposefully narrow and fails to address any of his successes, and think he should receive some credit for the success of his ideas being adopted quickly after his death.','1r7uek',1,0,3,3,NULL,0,0),(6,1385138347,'cdkj4ra','scrash','r/changemyview',0,'McKinley and Garfield were assassinated and no one thinks they were that great.','1r7uek',0,0,0,0,NULL,0,0),(1,1385138879,'cdkjcmu','no_en','r/changemyview',0,'[11/21 Robert F.

We can look for and eliminate confounders and collinearity, we have tools that point out singular influential cases, etc. These tools allow us the ability to perform more \"natural experiments\" to borrow your terminology because we can take more measurements and use more variables to try to model the phenomena in question. We won\'t be perfect, be even our physical laws aren\'t really only approximations to what actually happens. For example, take Newton\'s Law of Gravitation. Yes, GR supersedes it, but even before the 20th century people knew it wasn\'t perfect. Newton\'s Law only covers gravitational attraction between two bodies, but no more. We know that a body\'s movement is affect by more than one other body, but Newton\'s Law usually gives us a good enough approximation for most situations. Still though, it is only an approximation of what happens in reality.\n\n3) Most importantly, rationalism requires that you start off with correct laws or axioms. The best example of a rationalist discipline is mathematics. Since the late 19th century, math has been put on rigorous foundations (as much as it can be) and thus we know that we can derive any result not independent of an axiomatic system based on the initial axioms of the system (to see more about this, you can look up the ZFC axiomatic set theory for a theory that underlies all (most) of math; you can also look up Group theory with its limited axioms to get a somewhat less abstract example).\n\nIn regards to macroeconomics, I don\'t know of any axioms that underlie it from which we can derive the laws we know today. In fact, as an example, Austrian Economics has tried to use rationalism instead of empiricism to conduct macroeconomic analysis. However, they axiom they start off with (the Action Principle or something like that) leads to conclusions that don\'t match up with the empirical conclusions found in the field. \n\nIn all, it is hard to say that a few results that break from a theory \"falsify\" it. Sometimes the theory is wrong (see Caloric Heat Theory and Miasmatic Theory of Disease) and other times our model was just a simplistic approximation of what actually happens (see Newtonian Gravity, Bohr\'s Atomic Model, Neo-Keynesianism, etc.). Usually when we are stuck we empirical results that disagree with our theory, we will check is the results were anomalous or if they are accurate. If they are the former, then we can usually ignore them (say they occurred due to random chance or due to extreme circumstances that occur rarely and that the model is not built to model); however, if they are the latter, then we will go look at our theory and see how we can fix it to accommodate this new data. \n\nFinally, there is general agreement to how the macroeconomy works. There are usually big fights over Keynesianism vs. Classicism, but really after the 80s, both sides borrowed from each other and fixed each other up leading to New Keynesianism and New Classicism (as opposed to the Neo versions of both of these theories). They agree with each other more often than not and the disagreements are largely political and moral (not what is the best economical thing to do, but what should we do?). \n\nRationalism is a useful tool, but in any scientific field, empiricism must be superior. Without empiricism, contradictions in theories would never arise and we would never be able to apply rationalistic techniques to build a better theory.','2jyhbs',1,0,12,2,NULL,0,0),(1,1414018476,'clh0rxp','doc_rotten','r/changemyview',0,'I think the two MUST work together.  The use of rationalism can determine what is worth empirically verifying.  Controlled experiments may not exist, but empirical effects of policies or events can be evaluated.  Sales records are (normally) empirical, tax receipts are empirical.\n\nIn determination of any causality, there must be correlation.  Strength of correlation can be evidence of causation when controlled tests are not possible.\n\nSo, in truth, the best macroeconomics uses both rationality and empiricism, to evaluate and re-evaluate.  Many macro-economists avoid one or the other.\n\nThought experiments provide me insight into what to look for that is measurable or testable, which provides new information to incorporate into the thought experiments and build knowledge.

From what I\'ve heard of them, anarchists don\'t seem to be clear on what would replace coercive authority.  But something would.  Maybe it\'s pure woo, but they have some sort of verbiage there.  Maybe the difference is that we wouldn\'t have to tax ourselves to support the coercive apparatus of the state: then you would have to compare tax-exempt adequately-capitalized co-ops (where the workers are all exempt from income tax too, not just the firm itself) with tax-paying privately-owned businesses, in order to refute it.  Maybe they believe that businesses are very dependent on reputation, and that being a co-op brings an air of leftist radicalism.  Maybe they believe there\'s something ineffable about co-ops that benefits other co-ops, so that one co-op by itself is about as viable as one telephone in a world with no others to call.\n\nAll that being said, owning shares in the company you work for is usually a lousy idea, as employees of Enron discovered when they lost their jobs and their savings at the same time.  \n\nNone of the reasons why anarcho-communism will be different after the Revolution are really all that convincing.

This is done despite the fact that some of the most heinous international terrorists of the last 50 or so years have been financed by Saudi oil money.

Without control over a specific label associated with your product, and given that consumers cannot reasonably be expected to learn the details about the origins of every product they buy, you\'re opening up the masses to a world of confusion, quality and safety issues.\n\nA trademark is simply a label that means a specific person or company is responsible for the product being trademarked, and consumers depend on that specificity when making their decisions.','33t6fo',1,0,3,2,NULL,0,0),(3,1429973564,'cqo98yr','Jaysank','r/changemyview',0,'You seem to be missing the point for companies to have trade marks.

This is a big issue. In the previous example, all that the original company needed to do was see usage of their brand by a different company, then tell them to stop.

Not only does this mean that a company that wants to change direction and try something new must give up their previous branding, it also necessitates a neutral third party to manage these trademarks. Obviously, this must be the government, assuming that the regulations also come from the government. In our example, not only must the government constantly monitor the original producer of a product, but it also must investigate and make sure that **ANY COMPANY THAT USES ANY TRADEMARK IS CONSTANTLY MONITORED TO MAKE SURE ITS PRODUCTS STILL FITS THOSE QUALITY STANDARDS**.

I might pay more thinking I\'m getting OP\'s good quality widget when I\'m actually getting a shitty one.

Sure, but that\'s true of all forms of regulation. There\'s nothing particularly wrong with the way that we currently do it.\n\nEdit: For example, many many products can\'t be properly regulated by quality control because there\'s no fixed standard about what makes an acceptable burger (past minimum health standards which are regulated separately) - if you compete on the same branding, but one person makes a really lean burger and the other one a really fatty one, different consumers are going to like different options, but there\'s no easy way to tell which one is which.','33t6fo',1,0,2,2,NULL,0,0),(6,1430534952,'cqvpdjg','blackflag415','r/changemyview',0,'>This is annoying.

Gregorian calendar provides variation in this which is actually a lot more of a natural and flowing setup in my view. Everyone gets their birthday on a weekend every so often instead of either never or always.\n\nYou mention Christmas falling on Sunday as a \"problem\", when in fact for most countries it\'s a gift, since AFAIK most jurisdictions and corporations provide the following Monday (26th) in lieu of Christmas Day in that case, and Friday (24th) in cases where Christmas is on Saturday. In your proposal, not only would this never happen, but Dec. 25 would always be on a Thursday, meaning you\'d never have a Christmas long weekend again. Given the laws I mentioned above, the only worse day for Christmas to fall on other than Thursday is Wednesday. At least if it were a Tuesday, Monday would be Christmas Eve so many companies already have a half-day off and will just shut down altogether to allow for a 4-day weekend.\n\n4th of July is **always** a Thursday in your calendar scheme, which isn\'t much better than Tuesday, which in the Gregorian calendar is at least only every so often instead of permanently.

You would never need to consult the calendar again.\n\nOthers have already pointed out that it doesn\'t preserve all religious requirements, which doesn\'t affect me per se, but it will certainly affect billions. And you have failed to convince me exactly how Monday always being on the 1st, 8th, 15th, and 22nd is a good thing. America already has \"fixed Monday\" holidays anyway, who cares if they don\'t always fall on the same day of the month? I also dispute your last point, consulting a calendar is not only simple, but just because the days of the month will always match the weekday names doesn\'t mean people will magically remember all of them, we\'d still need to check calendars. In fact I think it\'s a lot easier to remember which months have 31 days than it is to remember which weekday is assigned to each of the 28 calendar days. Do you remember which letter of the alphabet is the 18th letter?\n\n>Can you think of any reasons why this wouldn\'t be better?

None of your points convince me. Even worse, we haven\'t even tackled how it will affect backdating calculations and timespans.

No language that I\'m aware of has ever had a \"regulator\" and even if one did it wouldn\'t have made a difference.

The closest you might come to a successful constructed language is Various sign languages created for the deaf and mute, but even those have branched out and changed based on usage.\n\n>Rather than using Greek-derived names for the sciences, which are completely meaningless to the average learner of English until they learn the name of that particular science\n\nIn my quick reading regarding anglish this seem to come up a lot. I\'m not really sure it\'s a valid criticism. Basically the argument is that you don\'t know what words mean until you\'ve learned what those words mean. I\'m not sure where the problem is with that.

Why stop there? Wouldn\'t Germanic be even better? More pure? \n\nHow is our current version of English unclear, or inconsistent in any meaningful way? Do you have any proof that there is a large amount of miscommunication happening? Remember, that\'s the point of language, to communicate. Roots, purity, regulation and rules are all irrelevant to the fact that I need to tell you something and I\'m going to find a way to do that.\n\n\n','37b2pr',2,0,56,9,NULL,0,0),(13,1432637235,'crl78po','tropical_chancer','r/changemyview',1,'It is quite normal and natural for a language to incorporate words from other languages into its vocabulary. \n\nI\'m not sure \"bodylore\" would be easier than \"anatomy\" for an English language learner to learn since many languages use the same root English does for their word for anatomy. For example:\n\n* French - Anatomie\n* German  - Anatomie \n* Swahili - Anatomia\n* Nepali - Anatomi (if I\'m reading the Devanagari right)\n* Bhasa Indonesia - Anatomi\n* Kurdish - Anatomi\n* Oromo - Anaatoomiii\n* Tagalog - Anatomiya \netc.\n\nEnglish already uses a lot of Latin and Greek suffixes and prefixes which a lot of other languages use, so you\'d just be one set of prefixes and suffixes with another (and more obscure it seems) set of prefixes. \nAnd languages generally don\'t alter their grammar just because they\'ve adopted foreign words or phrases into their vocabulary, they usually adopt the word and fit it into their own grammar and even phonology. For example the Amharic word for \"hotel\" is \"hotel\" and when you want to say the \"the hotel\" you simply add \"-u\" to the word, becoming \"hotelu\" like you would with any Amharic word.  \n\nI\'m not sure how much having an English language regulator would change grammar, since that\'s intrinsic to the language itself. One of the main problems with English is that it is a widely spoken language, and the majority of speakers are outside of the language\'s \"homeland.\" So when it comes to spelling reforms, whose pronunciation would you use? Certainly the English could lay claim to it, but exactly which English pronunciation? So you might end up basing new spelling conventions on the speech on a small subset of English speakers, which actually isn\'t all that useful.

There are roughly 77 million native French speakers in the world. By comparison, English, which has no such authoritative regulator, has about 400 million speakers. It is the language of [business](https://hbr.org/2012/05/global-business-speaks-english), the [language](http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-29543708) of [science](http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2015/01/english_is_the_language_of_science_u_s_dominance_means_other_scientists.html), even the language of international [air travel](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/761307/English-to-become-compulsory-for-pilots.html). It is overall seen as the [dominant](http://www.cepr.org/PRESS/DP2055PR.htm) international language today: where a Belgian and an Argentinian may not speak each other\'s native language, there is a reasonable chance they both speak English, and so has a great deal of utility. At best, French is maintained as the language of [diplomacy](http://www.economist.com/blogs/johnson/2013/04/languages-diplomacy) but even that is starting to be supplanted by [English](http://www.legallanguage.com/legal-articles/language-of-diplomacy/), which makes sense considering that more people know English by many, many degrees. Ironically enough, French is no longer the lingua franca in much of the world. \n\nWhy is this? Partially, it can be explained by the political dominance of, first, the British Empire and, immediately after, the American Empire. But another reason is that, contrary to your assertion, its willingness to absorb the words of other languages makes it easier to pick up and use by non-native speakers. French, and other linguistically purist cultures, take a protectionist approach to their language, carefully pruning it to make sure it grows only in the way they want it to grow. By contrast, English takes a more free market approach, where words can easily cross borders and be changed to suit the needs of whomever uses them--if French is a carefully pruned topiary, English is an all-devouring kudzu vine. While a topiary certainly looks better, and may be less bothersome, none can argue that it grows faster, and requires less maintenance, than kudzu. This, in fact, is criticized as [linguistic imperialism. ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_imperialism) Whether or not one agrees that the spread of English is a good thing, none can deny that this is indeed happening on a mass scale. \n\nThis makes intuitive sense: a language that can be easily adapted and modified and changed will spread more quickly than a language that cannot, because ultimately languages are utilitarian creatures. People learn them to use them, and if a language is more difficult to use, then it will be more difficult (and less appealing) to learn. English readily accepts loan words. French, official \"proper\" French (not speaking of colloquial French here), does not. English is simply a more hospitable environment for foreign words, and this has in turn made English more attractive. If we think of it in terms of nations, all other things being equal, which country will have more immigrants: one with an open door policy and a speedy path to citizenship, or one with a highly restrictive immigration policy with an exhaustive and lengthy path to citizenship? \n\nSo, contrary to your view, English\'s lack of regulation has actually made it *easier* to learn, not harder. The trouble people have when learning English usually has to do mainly with the grammar structure than the vocabulary. This is a good problem to have, because a vocabulary mistake can be easily corrected, while a grammatical mistake (we\'re talking big ones, like wrong word order, versus ending sentences with prepositions) cripples understanding. Further, while this is highly subjective (but then again, so is your point), I believe that English\'s willingness to change and adopt foreign words as its own (and adopt and change foreign words too) makes it very beautiful. There are concepts that simply cannot be expressed with English words on hand, and so it\'s quite useful to be able to simply take another word to fill in the gap, and so thereby increase the language\'s range of expression. If we were only restricted to Anglo-Saxon derived words, the things we could communicate would, I believe, contract significantly. \n\nUpon further thought, I also find it odd you would single out English for having inconsistencies in grammar, spelling, pronunciation and more--every language has weird things about it that can confound even native speakers. This even includes French. Much of this inconsistency comes from colloquial usage and geographic diversity. Sure, it\'s weird that some people insist on calling \"soda\" \"pop\" instead, but I don\'t think the country needs to settle on one definitive word to use for \"sugary, fizzy beverage.\" \n\nUltimately, to trap the English language in amber like some Jurassic-era mosquito is to remove the vitality, dynamism, adaptability and diversity that makes it such a strong language in the first place. This does mean, of course, that the English of today won\'t be the English of 100 years from now, just as it\'s not the English of 100 years ago, but that\'s a feature, not a bug. A language that cannot, will not, adapt will find itself to be like a highly specialized organism that does extremely well for its niche but is unable to adjust to changing circumstance--and those organisms tend to go extinct much faster. \n\n','37b2pr',1,0,6,3,NULL,0,0),(3,1432653350,'crldoux','NeilZod','r/changemyview',0,'English follows rules; it doesn\'t obey orders.

Despite receiving orders to stop splitting infinitives and to stop stranding prepositions, English speakers have kept doing both. Try to create an organization to issue greater directives and watch as it suffers a greater failure.\n\nI believe it is John McWhorter, a well-known linguist, who argues that languages become easier to understand if it experiences large numbers of adults learning the language as adults. The most difficult languages happen when the only new speakers are the children of the current speakers. If you look at the history of English, you can see that successive waves of others mixing into English as adults. Therefore, we can argue that English fits the example of a language that is easier to learn because other adults learned it as adults.\n\nIn other news, r/Anglish should just give up and learn Frisian.

You would essentially be creating an entirely new language. \n\nThe concept of language regulators is a relatively new concept that developed during colonial times. In fact, the oldest thing that resembles a current language regulator is the Oxford ENGLISH Dictionary. This was created long after Old Norman had entered the picture. It should also be noted that a lot of the major differences in American and British spelling and pronunciation came about when organizations tried to codify the language, as you are suggesting we do.\n\nAs a bookkeeper, I think it is wrong to imply that English does not create words using simple concepts. I also think it is wrong to suggest that creating words out of simple concepts would streamline English or make it easier to understand. A bookkeeper could also be a librarian or a bookstore owner using your version of English. On /r/Anglish they give kangaroo as an example, explaining that \"leapdeer\" could be an alternative, but what would call gazelle, or impala, or antelopes? They are all types of deer that have a penchant for leaping. Anglish may have worked 1300 years ago when the world was a much simpler place, but English has evolved with the times to describe the ever-expanding universe.\n\nFrom what I can tell, most contemporary Germanic languages use variations of the greek words to describe sciences. So English is not alone in that change. I also find the concept of calling Geology \"Earthlore\" upsetting. As lore in contemporary English has the connotation of being fictitious, and the only people who view Geology as fictitious are creationists! \n\nOn a personal level, the reasons you give for wanting a language regulator are the reasons I love English. English is not pretentious, it is not caught up in maintaining itself or its purity. I like that we argue over the Oxford comma and the pronunciation of gif (HARD G). That we add selfie to the dictionary and that we don\'t call tacos \"stuffed flat bread\". If a language already has a word for something we just take it as is (minus some bastardization for pronunciation purposes) and add it to the dictionary. If it doesn\'t have a word for it and move on. I like that we do not have an official body that is fretting over whether outside influences are destroying our language and culture.

While a real-time chat room is ideal, a linear thread will still do if you press F5 a lot, but a hierarchical thread will be very hard to follow in real time. And when you come back to one of these threads after the event is completed, the linear thread is easier to follow, since you can better understand the context of when each comment was made. E.g.\n\n* In a thread about an E3 conference, if someone comments \"this is pretty boring so far\", it\'s important to know if this was made before or after <insert important game> was announced.\n* In a thread about a soccer match, if someone seems nervous about their favourite team\'s chances, it\'s important to know if this was before or after that team scored the equalizer.\n* In a thread about a TV episode, if someone comments that they don\'t like the episode so far, it\'s important to know if this was made before or after the crazy plot twist.\n\nGames like Mafia/Werewolf are also much better with a linear thread for similar reasons - the way you interpret a comment (as suspicious or trustworthy) might be very different depending on which comments were made beforehand.','38kv3z',1,0,1,2,NULL,1,0),(2,1433527943,'crwp8pl','[deleted]','r/changemyview',0,'Dont forget about groupthink. \n\nWhen a group is subjected to the same opinions over and over without any minority opinions it creates an echo-chamber where people are oblivious to outside schools of thought.

I think our use of money is really unimaginative. Why do we only have one kind of currency? There are plenty of cultures in which certain things can only be exchanged for certain other things, constituting a system of multiple currencies. For example, the price of houses could use a completely different currency than everything else, a currency that is distributed to the population in a different way than wage-labour. \n\nI\'m a communist, more or less, but I believe in supply and demand -- good way to understand an economy\'s capacities. Thing is, the way it\'s understood now is that supply and demand only refers to the *market*, and it\'s well known that private companies have a vested interest, and great skill, in creating demand and manipulating supply. There are many items produced which fill no gap in demand, and so have demand created through extremely elaborate campaigns. Meanwhile, there are very obvious demands that cannot be met by the logic of the market. Everyone needs adequate housing, so the market can always price some people out of *having* adequate housing, because the demand will always be there.\n\nIn the meantime, people and banks pay and accept payment for houses with imaginary negative money (debts, mortgages, and all kinds of horrifyingly sketchy financial \'instruments\') usually representing sums outside the grasp of many many people. \n\nSometimes there is a social supply and demand which is not met by the market\'s supply and demand.

We give non-trade systems a much harder time that we give our own system, conceptually, forgetting the complicated matter of the institutional development of a workable system, and disregarding the fact that the Westernisation of the entire world has begun roughly 500 years ago, without any serious competitors. Even anti-capitalists argue against capitalism while conceptualising it in a way that is affected by capitalist biases (for example, the greed vs. altruism dichotomy as a supposedly important source of motivation for work). A lot of such debates had gone stale a long time ago, and I\'m trying to bring some fresh points and models into this debate.\n\nMoney serves several functions: a fungible medium of exchange (as an improvement upon barter); a demand signal (the function which you mentioned); a threshold for dictating whether the transaction should occur (that bars out people who don\'t have the money to pay the price); a material incentive for showing up at work, improving performance, and innovating; a way to ensure the transaction is equitable (the value of the good should be the same as the value you pay for it); under the guise of profit, a mechanism for filtering out of the economy enterprises that fail to deliver value to customers, and so on. It\'s a remarkably elegant system, that works acceptably well for its purposes (it doesn\'t always work perfectly, for reasons I\'ll go into a tad later). However, that\'s about as much as you can demand out of it. It also introduces huge and unique problems into economic systems.\n\nFor starters, it\'s probably the biggest example of [Goodhart\'s Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Goodhart%27s_law) in action. Instead of maximising value provided to the market, people maximise money received. Profits incentivise huge efforts to distort the signal provided by prices through entire industries such as advertising, marketing, and sales, that a lot of the time rely on dirty psychological manipulation. An artificial boost in demand means people work more and pay more for stuff that isn\'t that good and necessary in the end. The use of money expands the range of services necessary in a society beyond stuff like healthcare, education, and personal/home care services and into business management, banking, retail, consulting, and so on, meaning that a technologically advanced economy that didn\'t use money could (all else being equal) relocate large swathes of its employed populace from the filmsier service sectors to sectors that produce real, tangible wealth, such as artisanship, engineering, and medicine, without compromising on agriculture and manufacturing (because technological advancement renders the necessary numbers of workers in such industries to below 10% of the workforce for manufacturing and below 5% for agriculture).\n\nThe function of money-as-threshold, especially combined with high prices, produces terrible mismatches between supply and demand such as food rotting on supermarket shelves while people go hungry, or the number of unsold homes surpassing that of homeless people. This is a completely crappy economic outcome (it\'s like, *come on, money, you had one job, that to match supply and demand*) and is also inherent in the system, possibly requiring state action to reverse. **In capitalism, demand is not directly found out by asking customers what they want and how much of it, but gauged indirectly through sales volumes.** With the performance of today\'s computers, it should be possible for producers and consumers to negotiate the volume and kind of supply through some sort of online communication (like Amazon, but with everything free) to arrive at a compromise that satisfies people\'s needs without placing burdens on producers to work 16 hours a day.\n\nThe fact that firms live out of their profits disincentivises certain cost-intensive but unprofitable pursuits (like theoretical physics research or space exploration), incentivises planned obsolescence and the use of poor-quality but cheap products, greatly reduces the market share of certain very impressive skills that aren\'t as cost-efficient as their shoddier counterparts (hand-crafted products and solid, monumental, ornate architecture) and so on. In a moneyless system, you don\'t have cost restrictions, only natural production limits. While workers are toiling away at building a particle accelerator, you don\'t have to worry about making sure the thing gets you more money than you invested, just about making sure that workers are well-fed, healthy, and materially satisfied, and that the rough materials needed (rare metals or whatever) are available. In such a system, you wouldn\'t be limited by higher cost in choosing environmentally friendly technologies; the shock produced by such industries could be absorbed by the more efficient parts of the economy. It would theoretically allow an economy to grow to the full size and quality level that its physical and labour resources allow. Its bottom line is measured in welfare, not money.\n\nCurrently, the main theoretical weakness of non-monetary economies is that not much realistic thought has been given to the details of making them work. At this stage, it\'s just the skeleton of an idea, polluted by historical association with murderous, ideologically bankrupt, deplorably poor regimes. As it stands, it has literally one school of thought behind it (Marxism, and it\'s wrong), and everyone invested in making it work is too heavily biased and ideologically motivated to take an honest look at their own construct and not be wildly optimistic about it. By contrast, the capitalist system benefits from: a legal framework that has been finely-tuned for making money work, from laws forbidding theft to the arcane details of corporate law; adjacent financial institutions like banks and stock exchanges; the political support of all the parties that stand a chance at election; a quantitative field that studies it, with laws and equations and precise predictions; a surrounding culture that grew around it, welcomed trade-related terms in popular vocabulary, and modelled the mindsets of the general populace to not even conceive of anything non-monetary. We\'re not ancient enough to remember the medieval condemnation of usury, but capitalism has fought and won so many ideological battles that it became such a default position that we don\'t even perceive the ideology behind it. It\'s a much, much more mature system. Don\'t hold your 4-year-old to the same standards you hold yourself.\n\nThere are certain limitations on the kind of society a non-monetary economy can output, though. The population size and density of its cities would probably be at pre-modern levels. A return to a more particularist, clannish, in-group-ish, non-cosmopolitan way of thinking may be in order (such a society needs every drop of social cohesion it can get). It would not be incentivised to output rapidly changing cycles of trends in clothing, music, and media, so it would necessarily be less glitzy and might not have anything akin to shopping malls. (I just came home from the mall, so boo hoo.) Personally I regard these changes as either favourable in their own way or an acceptable price for the benefits brought by such an economy.\n\n(Part 1 of 2 - next comment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3b6eh6/cmvcurrency_is_an_incredibly_useful_tool_for_any/csju1lf))','3b6eh6',0,0,0,0,NULL,0,0),(1,1435351964,'csju1lf','antichristina','r/changemyview',0,'(Part 2 of 2 - previous comment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3b6eh6/cmvcurrency_is_an_incredibly_useful_tool_for_any/csju0am))\n\nThe big obstacle is filling the place of the incentivising function of money, towards being a more industrious and efficient worker or producer. (Or, as put by typical opponents of anything \"communist\": blah blah human nature blah blah greed blah blah blah utopian blah blah not gonna happen.) The problem is real, but there are reasons to believe it\'s not insurmountable. Different arrangements and policies impact people differently. The small scale of an economy (in the tens of thousands, or hundreds of thousands) can make any contribution, or lack thereof, very visible. An opt-in social experiment will be more successful than a brutally enforced regime by an unpopular authority. Contributing to society can be several flavours of compulsory even when you leave conditioned material reward out of the picture. Well-managed, meritocratic, somewhat hierarchical workplaces can make a big difference. A society with greater social cohesion will inspire more and better willful contributions from members. Direct feedback from consumers can be used to improve the efficiency of producers. Membership in production units could be public, so that you may wake up with a mob on your lawn if you laze about and let your industry fail. Some mild amount of social stratification and status rewards can motivate people where money cannot (a point that is particularly easy to miss from the political left). The devil is in the details, of course; these are just some ideas off the top of my head to illustrate to you what can be done.\n\nSome would probably worry about people hoarding free goods instead of being forced to make wise purchasing decisions, but that doesn\'t sound very likely. People can only eat so many calories a day without getting obese (and rotten food is very yucky to clean up), only have so much storage space for various physical goods in their home, and good luck getting builders to make you a giant mansion when you don\'t pay them.\n\nSome people here have talked about post-scarcity being the only thing that can make \"communism\" possible. Look. We don\'t *absolutely need* work to be considerably more automated than it already is (and once the disincentives disappear if it becomes a matter framed in terms of \"public welfare\" and \"letting people relax\" rather than \"unemployment\", we might see more stuff actually getting automated). To demand to have every produced item at your fingertips, with no human labour input, before we can talk about moneyless systems is to be a spoiled brat. And you won\'t make it with that attitude, comrade. Any kind of physical production is pretty efficient already, save fields like medicine or theatre where human input cannot be done away with, and many people engage in these fields vocationally. We don\'t *loathe* working as much as capitalist ideologues would have us believe, many people in fact feel a bit guilty about unemployment even when provided for, like young adults and stay-at-home mothers. We\'re post-scarcity enough for all practical purposes, just watch a How It\'s Made episode to get convinced.\n\nSorry for not going fully into the details for all of my assertions. In all honesty, the entire thing would probably fill a book or several. I hope this may come as a useful perspective from someone who desires to live in a moneyless economy.','3b6eh6',1,0,17,2,NULL,0,0),(0,1435353410,'csjuxia','abisiden','r/changemyview',0,'May I recommend you read the works by Karl Marx?

There\'s no reason that you couldn\'t trade 5 minutes of office work for a loaf of bread (possibly through some intermediaries) if all of the bookkeeping takes place in the background.

So the high-end data-analyst / analytics engineer is every bit at risk as is the truck-driver or the store clerk. So in this way long before we having every single job obliterated, or a completely autonomous economy we will have a substantially autonomous economy, where simply put, there isn\'t enough work for everyone.

Let\'s use economics. If one is having a specific debate about an economics issue and you start spouting off a bunch of \"common sense\" stuff to make your point, ignoring the massive amount of work done in the field to date about said topic, or even misunderstanding basic concepts, that person would be right to tell you to go home and educate yourself until you can come to the table prepared. And to ask someone to \"summarize\" a bunch of the discipline just for you, as if they owe it to you, is unreasonable. However in a different discursive context it might be ok to ask for people to explain a bunch of ideas in the field you are discussing. A debate is not one of them. \n\nLikewise, if someone wrote a article (especially an academic one) about a debated topic and they didn\'t do their research and didn\'t understand the conversations going on about the topic and they try to inject themselves into the debate, the community would be right to either ignore them (probably won\'t get published) or tell them \"educate themselves\" on the current discourse. \n\nIf someone says to you, \"go educate yourself\", you might just have to at least consider the possibility that you are that person who butts into the middle of a conversation to express an opinion with out knowing the context of the conversation or expects everyone to fill you in on everything. This social justice crowd is not the only people that use something like this. In some cases, the social justice crowd may in fact be right. \"You don\'t know what institutional oppression is and how it is used in social justice speak and you want to debate me about it? Well, go fuck off until you do know.\" \n\nIdeally, when one says \"go educate yourself\" they would at least be helpful enough to point you in the right direction.

Or, if not the same way, to the same degree. Or, if not to the same degree, with the same kinds of results. That where this idea goes off the rails. \n\nLet\'s assume, as with most things, people fall on a bell curve. Most people live in the middle, with some people being extremes on either end.  You are 100% correct that for certain jobs and ambitions, you have to be on the exceptional end of the bell curve: model, CIA agent, CEO, NFL player, etc. And, since we\'re not really talking about it, we\'ll ignore the other end wherein people are unusually deficient in a particular skill. \n\nNo, maybe you\'re not super smart. Or athletic, charismatic, good at the trumpet, or phenomenal in bed.  That\'s okay, that\'s expected, most people are right in the neat middle of the bell curve. Or, rather, it SHOULD be okay. \n\n**The problem with beauty is not that the bell curve doesn\'t apply, it is the business scheme underwriting it that exploits the bell curve**. \n\nYeah, I\'m not a super model, never will be, that\'s fine. I am still attractive enough. But there are certain needs that everyone has to meet. First are food, shelter, sustenance. You have to survive. Then comes safety (no use worrying about your existential crisis if you\'re being chased by a lion). But then comes *love*. Belonging. Feeling included, appreciated, desirable. We all have this need, we all feel it with a biological imperative to complete it and be successful. And that makes us weak. It makes us vulnerable. \n\nThe genius thing the beauty industry has done (fashion, skin care, cosmetics, hair products, etc. etc.) is use the outliers on the bell curve to distort the middle. It does this for men and women, no one gets away from this. But not JUST the outliers. Even extremely beautiful women are photo-shopped into unattainable images of perfection. By keying into that universal need, to be wanted, they create a huge market demand for a way, any way, to get that need met. The further you get from the middle, the more exaggerated and unattainable \"pretty\" becomes, the more products you sell. I mean, this is basic common sense. So models move further and further towards the most extreme end of the bell curve because those are the people who will sell the most diamonds, skin cream, and boots. The further you feel from perfect, the more you\'ll spend to raise your position. \n\n**This market doesn\'t exist (to the same extent) for other extremes**. Yeah, you can\'t be an idiot, but there\'s a wide range of acceptable intelligence and not a lot of money to be made in exploiting it. We encourage sports, but few people expect they\'ll go pro. There\'s money to be made there, don\'t be fooled (Nike, Gatorade, Adidas, REI, pick your thing) but not NEARLY as much because athletic prowess doesn\'t have the same imperative behind it that being loved does. The reason the beauty industry is so harmful is because it makes its money by making you feel artificially ugly and unfit.

Yes,  people\'s perceptions of their own self worth can change based on external factors - but those factors differ from person to person. The relevant theory in psychology (or one of them) is called the theory of contingent self-worth. In this theory, it is posited that self esteem is both a stable trait and a fluctuating state - that is, people\'s self esteem tend to fluctuate around a certain level depending on their perceived performance in those areas of their lives that are important to them.  \n\nThere are many areas that people excel in but typically people don\'t tend to care about all of them.  For example, in some cultures, the ability to track might be an important skill but it doesn\'t have the slightest importance for me. \n\nSo. Failing to meet different standards will have different impacts on different people depending on how important meeting those standards are to them. It\'s absolutely not uniform. \n\n In body image, there are increased risks of eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa, which is among the most dangerous of all mental illnesses. Further, in physical appearance there can be enormous social pressure to fit ideal beauty standards, so it is complicated by that issue. Additionally, physical appearance is always able to be perceived by others unless they are blind. That is not the case in other areas much of the time. To look at me, no one would know if I were good at my job or not, but how i look is immediately obvious and ready for others to assess and judge.\n\nYou are correct in that anyone who has a strong sense of perfectionism and is maladaptive about it can experience enormous distress that can focus on pretty much everything.

You might rightly argue that professional athletes are stressing their bodies to the extent that long term health is impacted, but the average person doesn\'t have the time to train like a professional athlete.

Want to learn an instrument? Doable (I used to be damn near tone deaf, yet ended up graduating university with an honours degree in music). Born with an ugly face? Oops, too bad. Your options are makeup (lies and fakery, without actually improving YOU) or plastic surgery (expensive and risky).\n\n2.

Studying new things or improving your leadership skills can improve your life and sense of self-worth, even if you never use those new skills around another human being.

You don\'t do it for you, as you aren\'t the one looking at yourself all day, and since beauty is inherently subjective and arbitrary, you can only gauge your success by how others judge you. There\'s also no end goal, since the goals presented in the media are literally unattainable by any natural human being.

While the 77 cents on the dollar number is touted by vocal feminist activist groups, it\'s given without context. It\'s presenting the just what the raw data tells us. Now, feminist economists and non-feminist economists alike tend to come to the same end numbers after they\'ve adjusted for factors which explain that gap, and that leaves us with a 5-7% unexplained wage gap between men and women. (or 6-8%, it\'s been a while since I\'ve read the literature) Depending on your ideological outlook and what kind of extra data you want to use, that gap can be explained as personal choices, discrimination in the workplace, or pre-market factors affecting the workplace (discriminatory hiring practices, for example). Most economists tend to settle somewhere between 40-60% being accounted for by discrimination, and the rest being made up by personal choices. (Whether those personal choices are influences by external social factors is a good question also). The point being here that \"feminists lie using misleading statistics\" is itself a little misleading as there are many feminists who don\'t. They are typically the ones doing the work itself and not trying to get public support anyway. \n\nAnd to be honest, that\'s really par for the course. Most political, social, or activists groups or parties do this, so feminists being singled out here seems a little selective. And it wouldn\'t be so bad if it wasn\'t happening for the men\'s side as well. CAFE used some misleading statistics with regards to their billboard about male victims of DV. They said that half the victims of DV were male. That was true, but also misleading because it, like the 77 cents, left out important and relevant context which shows that women are at a far higher risk to be seriously injured, fear for their lives, or be murdered by the SO. Domestic violence can be anything from a shove or a slap to being put into intensive care, and presenting it as equal without the full context will mislead people, just like the 77% number. So at this point, who can we trust? That activist feminists use misleading statistics in their advocacy is not exclusive to feminism, it\'s happens everywhere on all sides of all debates, so maybe we shouldn\'t be so quick to single out feminism here.\n\nAbout boys in education, boys aren\'t \"failing\" in education. In fact, they\'ve remained unbelievably consistent and haven\'t up or down in any significant way. What\'s happened is women have passed them in high school and college graduation rates. However, that\'s somewhat explained by men having more career and post-secondary opportunities available to them outside of academia. Men dominate trades and trade school, with them making up 97% of the students which absolutely needs to be accounted for if you\'re dealing with education. Male high school graduates also tend to be able to get better paying jobs than female high school graduates. There are a lot of factors to look at here that don\'t make the comparison easy at all.\n\nThe point I\'m getting at here is that all these problems tend to be a lot more complex than they\'re usually presented as, and that goes for both sides really. Most of the time each side will use the metric that supports their goals rather than looking at more factors that might undercut their position. That\'s on top of the fact that many of these things are incomparable due to their categorical differences. We can only compare like to like. So we can compare male and female arrest rates to each other and say that men are disadvantaged there, and we can compare rates and severity of DV between men and women and say that women have it worse there. What we can\'t do is say that elevated arrest rates for men are worse than elevated rates of serious injury for women victims of DV in any kind of objective way whatsoever.\n\nI\'m not saying that men don\'t have problems. They do, and they ought to be addressed too. But there\'s simply no way to objectively assess who\'s got it worse, and to be honest it usually just comes down to how much weight you personally feel certain issues have, which is almost always based on which are more likely to personally affect you and nothing else. There\'s nothing wrong with that, but that you think they\'re all worse than problems facing women or girls probably comes down to you being able to relate to them more and not much else.','3uduet',1,0,1,2,NULL,1,0),(1,1448702323,'cxfle7t','skepticalbipartisan','r/changemyview',0,'I\'ve been blackout drunk enough times to know what the end of consciousness feels like.

They\'ve fought with teeth and claw for equality, to get funding for women\'s issues, to get campaigns going for things like breast cancer, and so on. \n\nMen, on the other hand, typically never talk about men\'s problems. We haven\'t ever, as a group, talked about domestic violence against men, we don\'t really discuss prostate and testicular cancer, male rape or anything like that. And all this while men have control of the vast majority of all wealth and political power in the world. And yet, men never talk about these issues. Except when they can do it as an argument for why feminism is bad, as if retaining the status quo is the best thing imaginable for men. \n\nAnd why is that? Because of the same gender roles that feminism is fighting against. Men are supposed to be strong, to be providers, to never show emotions or weakness. That\'s why men are drafted, why men \"cannot be raped\", why male domestic abuse (by women) is so stigmatised, why male suicide rates are so high, why male diseases aren\'t discussed, and so on. And yet ... men aren\'t standing along feminist\'s vigorously fighting against these roles, or raising awareness for men\'s issues. We men are just silent on the issues, even though we have all the power to change things. \n\nAnd again - except for when it can be combined with attacks on feminism, which why Men\'s Rights Activism doesn\'t attract any support from feminists. Even you\'re doing it here, when you\'re blaming feminism for making things worse for men, taking stabs at things such as\n\n> the pushes of Yes means Yes laws which reverses the burden of proof to the defendant to prove they got consent, circumcision being legal while FGM is not\n\nEven though you should be perfectly aware that FGM and male circumcision (whatever you think of it) are insanely different things, and despite very strict rape laws, it\'s still extremely difficult to get people convicted for rape (really, if you look at Sweden, that has attempted this several times, it\'s still really difficult to convict people for rape, and no, you don\'t need written consent before having sex). \n\ntl;dr: men\'s issues aren\'t categorically worse, because men have all the power to change things but haven\'t. Men, as a group, are happy with the status quo, because actually fixing these issues requires relinquishing our other advantages. If we wanted to change things, we could, because we have the power. All we gotta do is start speaking up, and if we do so without simultaneously blaming feminism for everything that men are suffering, they\'d be happy allies, because the goals would be the same.

Equity feminism is what most of us think of as feminism and is essentially the \"equal treatment of women\". It is essentially the level playing field, removal of double standards, setting a meritocracy, and giving men and women equal opportunity to do what they like in life.\n\n*Gender feminism* is what she refers to as the gender-based theories of conditioning and social constructionism, based on post-modernist theory.\n\nThe difference ultimately is that equity feminism doesn\'t require that you subscribe to any sort of *causal* explanation of differences between men and women. There could be biology, environment, nurture, or whatever. None of that causal explanation is relevant to whether or not there are rules that unfairly block or subsidize one or the other.\n\nGender feminism requires that you start with a causal belief in an ideology, such that images of women in magazines *cause* certain treatment of women, or video games, or words or phrases.\n\nSommers highly supports equity feminism, has been one since the 60s, and even taught feminism for a time in the 80s. She even wrote a book *Freedom Feminism* that aims to bring together different versions of feminism in areas they overlap to actually accomplished some useful outcomes with aligned goals.\n\nSo I think it is fair to say she is very pro-equity feminism and anti-gender feminism. Even if you want to divide feminism compartments differently, then some she\'ll be pro and some she\'ll be anti, as is the case in many fields. She criticized both what some call \"victim feminism\" (actively seeking to portray women as victims of society or of some patriarchial force) and \"fainting couch feminism\" where safe spaces are created because these types of feminists believe women can\'t handle controversial topics, debate, or dissent and need a place to escape. (We used to call this suggestion *misogyny* when men said it, as even Naomi Wolf did in *The Beauty Myth*, but it seems to have become a feminist belief now.)\n\nThis is why I think it\'s all about trying to grab the label. Those who hold views aligned with gender feminism will tend to consider their views as the only thing that makes up feminism, and criticizing these views then makes one anti-feminist. \n\nIn some ways it\'s much like the silly issue of whether Islam is a religion of peace or of war. Well, these aren\'t mutually exclusive since there are different beliefs that fall under that same label.\n\nSo I can\'t say whether you are right or wrong, just that labels have fuzzy boundaries and different sub-groups have vested interests in taking the title for themselves.

If I make a post on Tumblr that 5 people like but everyone else hates then some of the people that hate it will comment, but most will ignore it. The people that like it may share it and those people are likely to have friends that agree with their viewpoints and that post might get shared tenfold. \n\nI say all this to point out that we are witnessing the actions and voices of people who started with little to no impact in their community. When these people argue for social justice there is no benchmark for what is truly justice and what is just revenge. If you want to criticize all Tumblr users then I don\'t think I can argue against it because the platform is just an amalgamation of various communities, cultures, and beliefs. If you want to say the idea of Social Justice \"breeds and is becoming more about revenge then helping people\" then I would argue (while trying to avoid the No True Scotsman\'s fallacy) that what someone may deem themselves a Social Justice Warrior but only argue for revenge against some personal persecution they believed occurred.

This emphasis exists, however, to bring into light exactly how identity *does, currently* affect the way individuals are treated, because without acknowledgement of and visibility into the problem, it is impossible to craft solutions.\n\nThat\'s why you\'ll certainly see discussion of privilege, but the highest levels of frustration with *unexamined* privilege.

It has not been my experience that the vast majority of people working in a social justice capacity are working against the privileged, they are working for the benefit of those not privileged.  Remember that while the worst possible things people do make the news, all of the people going about their daily lives doing things in a positive way to make peoples lives better will never make the news.  So there might also be some confirmation bias there as well.\n\nIf someone accidentally or intentionally steps on your neck would you tell them politely to remove their foot or would you get angry and/or forcibly remove it as quickly as possible.  This can lend to the image of social justice warriors as being angry and just as prejudiced.  I don\'t think it is easy for people who have not experienced daily discrimination to fully appreciate what it is like to constantly have a boot on your throat.  For some of the people experiencing the absolute worst discrimination they are not really concerned with your comfort, they are just trying to get the boot off their throat as quickly as possible.  Sometimes this gives a negative view of activism and strategy is not always as sound, but it does not necessarily make them wrong, after all their just trying to remove the boot.  A good example of this would be Black Lives Matters.  A lot of the strategy they employ does not always appear to be very unifying.  But from their prospective they live in a society where they can\'t even trust the very people you call in an emergency when you need someone the most.  Our citizens are dying.  This is urgent for people that live in poor neighborhoods.\n\n> \"my prejudice is okay because it\'s based in fact and isn\'t racism\".\n\nYea, these people are morons and likely don\'t work in social justice or if they do they are likely an outlier, not an example of the usual activist.\n\n>Whenever I look at privilege as used by social justice, it\'s used to say being treated decently is a privilege. It says that because other people may be treated worse, you\'re level of not being treated badly (and not even beneficially) is a privilege.\n\nThis has not been my experience of what it means to be privileged.  Being privileged is about having structural advantages.  It is not to say that people in a privileged situation did not work for what they have, but to say that people in privileged positions likely had none of the roadblocks and all of the structural advantages that non-privileged people have.  I am tall, white, male and middle class, I fully acknowledge that life has been easy for me.  I walk into an interview and the tall white male supervisor immediately trusts me.  When I get pulled over for speeding I get out of 80% of my tickets.  My wife on the other hand is brown, short and female.  The amount of scrutiny she receives for identical situations is astronomical.  And this when she is smarter and more successful than I, she has to work twice as hard just to meet me on an even playing field.  People tell her they are \"surprised\" by how professional and smart she is.  Why is this surprising? She always carries herself well, speaks eloquently and is successful at everything she does.  She nearly always receives a speeding ticket if pulled over.  (we both drive too fast).  Yes this is anecdotal, but it has made me realize that prejudice is not an occasional roadblock for disadvantaged people, but an everyday struggle to show people that you are just as trustworthy and intelligent as they are.  This can make people in this position a little jaded, so maybe that changes the rhetoric in casual conversation, but I don\'t think it changes how and what people are fighting for.  Yes, all people should have our advantages and lack of roadblocks, all people should be in a privileged position to be able to have agency in their own lives.','3vxs49',6,0,162,54,NULL,0,0),(-1,1449601100,'cxrttq3','bastthegatekeeper','r/changemyview',0,'>There\'s a bunch of stuff like all those \"male tears\" merchandise that is sold and bought and it just seems so against what I consider in bringing people up. This is a clear acceptance of these attitudes to me and I don\'t see how much good can come out from allowing them to flourish in a movement that is apparently designed to help make everyone equal.\n\nI think your issue is in expecting everyone to be perfect.  People advocating for social justice are human.  Would it be nice if every single one was able to put on a suffering martyr face 100% of the time, and never react with vitriol?  Sure.  But people are being impacted by injustices all the time, and it is frustrating.  So people make some jokes about male tears, because they are frustrated.  Because there are examples every day of injustices.  LGBT people, for instance, are more likely to be the victims of sexual assault and other violence than straight/cis people.  It is scary to be openly LGBT and it is suffocating to be closeted.  So when I\'m advocating for LGBT rights and someone comes along, telling me that \"they don\'t hate me they just think i\'m going to hell\" I might respond that I don\'t give a shit about their straight opinion.  Would it have been better if I had taken a breath and explained to them why they were wrong?  Maybe, but it\'s very rarely effective.  Would it have been better if I\'d said nothing?  Probably.  But I am frustrated, and I am imperfect.  And to demand perfection from minority groups when you are not criticizing the majority groups who are antagonizing them is deeply problematic.

It says that because other people may be treated worse, you\'re level of not being treated badly (and not even beneficially) is a privilege. This becomes an issue just when you examine the general reaction to the term privilege, people don\'t like the privileged. Privileged is viewed as undeserved, as unfair. People tend to not like being called privileged (hence why there always seem to be an inherent backlash whenever someone calls another person privileged). To be treated with some bare amount of respect is considered to be privileged while the lowest of the low are considered the default.\n\nYou are making an interesting point, and I can see how you got there.  Here are my thoughts:\n\n-  Privilege is something that some citizens enjoy, and other citizens do not enjoy.  When you have it, it makes life a lot easier.  People are nicer to you.  They are  more likely to trust you, to give you a job, to listen to what you have to say.  \n\n-  When you don\'t have privilege, people aren\'t as nice, are less likely to give you a job, and aren\'t interested in your views.  You don\'t have much power in your life, and there aren\'t many places you can turn where people have your back.\n\n-  In terms of money and survival, privilege matters because survival is hard, and if people think you are a waste of space, that makes it hard to survive.  Those speeding tickets, those times you are stopped because you \"fit the description\" of a perpetrator, the fact that you can\'t pay your bills, that no one will rent to you, that you aren\'t sure where your next meal is coming from, that teachers are mean to your kids.... that all makes for a pretty unhappy experience for those who don\'t have privilege.\n\n-  Sure, sometimes those who are really struggling see those who AREN\'T really struggling and feel some frustration.  Especially these days when the wealth disparity is so great.  It\'s not just that those really wealthy folk have all they need to survive and thrive, its that the really wealthy actually stack the deck against those who are weaker.  So, sure, we can see a little Marxism there - there\'s Bernie Sanders who has raised this issue and has labeled himself a socialist.\n\nI wouldn\'t call it revenge, though.  I would say that the goal is to level the playing field, and make improvements in our social structure so that all our citizens have a chance at a better life.  Right now, they don\'t all have that chance.  The American Dream isn\'t really alive for some folks in this country.\n\nIt might help if you got out more and really learned about what it\'s like to be poor in this country, or black.

No the outcomes would not be exactly equal, but if we controlled for the difference in numbers of minorities versus the number of majorities who applied for a job, and then also controlled for other background characteristics (education level, gpa, etc.), we would expect that given all things equal, the percentage of minorities who land a job should be about the same as the majority\'s percentage. \n\n* *How this may work (Hypothetical example)*\n\nSo let\'s look at a concrete (but still hyptohetical example). Let\'s call the majority group A and the minority group B. Let 10 people from group A apply for a job, and 5 people from group B apply for a job. Now let\'s say they all have the same background characteristics, and the only thing that is different is their minority-defining characteristic (race/gender/sexual orientation, etc.). If there are 10 open job slots, and 9 people from group A get a job, but only 1 person from group B gets a job (and a similar lopsided acceptance rate occurs across a LOT of different companies), we may begin to feel that there maybe some sort of greater systemic problem out there. Sure, maybe this sort of scenario could randomly happen at a few companies, but if the trend occurs in a lot of places, it maybe more than a trend (i.e.: 90% of A\'s accepted, but only 20% of B\'s, even though they all have the same background!).\n\n* *How you would judge this hypothetical example, and a bit of research*\n\nSo let\'s jump back out of hypothetical land. So in order to justify that affirmative action for jobs is necessary, we would need to argue that this sort of systemic problem occurs in business hiring. Such a process is difficult, mainly because there are no randomized experiments, and it\'s difficult to control for all the variables that could actually get a person a job. As /u/yyzjerti already anecdotally mentioned, the outcomes definitely appear to be skewed like our example (maybe not that lopsided, but still lopsided), however, just seeing those outcomes may not convince you that there is a greater problem. You could point this out to be the result of a number of other factors about the job candidates which make them unworthy applicants (although applying this to such a large number of cases seems a bit of a stretch to say the least). However, I will mention here that there is some economic research on this very subject that you can look into if you\'re having doubts on this front. And although the research is plagued by some of the biases I have already mentioned, it at least shows that the issue is relevant (see [this](http://www.nber.org/papers/w9873), there are more out there if you look into it).\n\n* *If the research isn\'t cutting it, which it may not*\n\nOkay, so maybe the pile of possible causal evidence still isn\'t cutting it for ya, and at this point you\'re still skeptical, which I guess you can always be with these social experiments, especially when their methodologies and scope are limited by time, money, and location. At these point then, we\'re left with only historical anecdotes and some non-causal data on both sides, but I\'ll try. It becomes difficult to do this without knowing what specific opinions you have on why affirmative action is bad.\n\nIt\'s difficult to prove discrimination against any particular group. If a group claims to be discriminated and we want to wait to acquire definitive proof that they\'re discriminated against, it may have long lasting implications on their job prospects (how long would it take to make it into a law!). It also has other connotations, such as pushing the status quo as superior over the minority group\'s claims which is also a seemingly unequal way to solve the problem. While I agree with some of the points you\'ve made in other discussions, that there can be negative consequences to affirmative action, such as letting someone who is underqualified from a minority group get a job insetead of a better qualified person from a majority group, any such anti-discriminatory job hiring prospect isn\'t going to be perfect. You could argue that merely scrapping affirmative action would \"level\" the playing field. But that would be to assume that people aren\'t discriminated at all in the job hiring process, which doesn\'t appear to be the case (as far as the research goes, and if we look into it further, we also find that research finds a pay gap as well.). Are there better ways to fight discrimination in the job hiring process?

The mental health implications are just now truly being explored.  And yet it is all about consent.  Sex is one of the most beautiful,  pleasurable, life-affirming things we do. We use it to express our love.  We use it to consummate our wedding vows.  But when one party doesn\'t consent, it can be one of the most traumatic, degrating, dehumanizing experiences and it leaves unimaginable scars. \n\nI bring this up because I don\'t think you\'re giving consent enough weight in your argument.

Your arguments are convincing, don\'t get me wrong, but ultimately you (or the father) have to convince her.

I\'m not suggesting that that pop-culture reminders of how temporary life is are good, don\'t get me wrong, I\'m just not sure that we\'re overly exposed to the temporary nature of life in developed nations. \n\nI certainly agree that in more developed nations depression is arguably an epidemic, but if exposure to death is the cause of such an experience, why don\'t we always see those same trends in less developed countries where individuals are almost certainly exposed to more death than we are?\n\nBeing a psychologist and someone who has traveled a bit and stayed in less developed countries, I\'ve often been amazed and overwhelmed by the friendliness of strangers or the happiness of those living in relatively extreme poverty. It\'s not universal of course, but often times in less developed countries people simply have a different relationship with death. In the US, when someone dies, it\'s almost rare to see them before the body is rushed off to a secluded place and made to look as \"alive\" as possible before it is again removed from view.\n\nIn many other much less developed countries you may find families preparing the bodies of loved ones for burial. Children are exposed to death from a young age, so it isn\'t quite as foreign to them. They adjust while young and it isn\'t so shocking when they reach adulthood. We, on the other hand, are often more insulated from death than most historical societies. We are often only reminded of death in the occasional abstract way, and when we do finally confront its reality, it can be a harsh and eye opening experience. Our unchallenged sense of our own permanence is called into question and this is often uncomfortable for most of us.\n\nI\'m also not sure that further insulation from death is a good answer to \"feeling\" better about it. In more developed countries we\'re not necessarily depressed because we\'re too exposed (although of course, in war torn regions great exposure to death can obviously be devastating, but even some of the stories of childhood soldiers having been rehabilitated is quite amazing). It is possible to make some degree of peace with the nature of our own temporary experience. People do it all the time. \n\nAnd what does insulating ourselves form death really protect us from? Eventually, if we\'re \"lucky\" enough to live a long life, being exposed isn\'t even an avoidable experience anyway. Sooner or later it will show up and if we weren\'t fortunate enough to learn good coping skills to deal with it in the past, it will likely be more difficult than ever to confront.\n\nI think hiding from death is worse, in some ways, than acknowledging and accepting the nature of our own existence. Death informs a well lived life. If we ignore the passage of time, our ever changing circumstances, and don\'t do our best to live fully because we recognize that we really don\'t have forever, then when those moments do arrive where we\'re finally confronted with the unavoidable nature of our own death, we\'re left with regrets. Because we didn\'t do the things that would have been important to a person who knew they didn\'t have forever to do it all.\n\nI\'d rather see the coming loss and live well in advance of it, than to pretend it wasn\'t coming and be full of regrets when it finally arrives.','3z1ruc',2,0,3,3,NULL,0,0),(5,1451687350,'cyiodtj','DashingLeech','r/changemyview',0,'Sure, but I think you\'re committing the same reaction:\n\n> What happens next is people telling them something like: \"Well, if you\'re not all like that, the ones are that are rational/peaceful/intelligent/kind/etc. need to speak up and put an end to it!\"\n\nThat\'s the fringe speaking, not the majority or rationals. \n\nI think there are far too many variables to account for in any one generalization. In some cases, the fringe are causing damage or are being portrayed as the mainstream. For example, Anita Sarkesian and Zoe Quinn actually got enough attention to get in front of the UN and potentially affect internet freedom. The both *represent* an authoritarian feminist fringe but also smear their critics in the GamerGate movement based on the rare fringe troll who sends them a threat, rather than the actual positions of the GamerGate movement (and ignoring the anti-gamergate fringe who is also violently threatening including multiple bomb scares).\n\nThe feminist fringes are also getting serious support right up to the White House, with Obama repeating the \"1 in 5\" false rape statistic. (The actual stats are that 1 in 53 will experience either rape, attempted rape, or threat of rape. The 1 in 5 is something quite different.) This fringe advocacy even led to the Office of Civil Rights to send out their infamous [2011 Title IX \"Dear Colleague\" letter](https://www.thefire.org/why-the-office-for-civil-rights-april-dear-colleague-letter-was-2011s-biggest-fire-fight/) that has resulting in many innocent people being seriously harmed by very bad policies at universities and colleges. This same moral panic is what drove Sabrina Erdely of Rolling Stone magazine to seek out examples of how there was a rape epidemic on campuses and the schools were doing nothing, and the only case she could find to back up the portrayal was the UVA story of Jackie that was a complete fabrication; but they pushed it through and [harmed many people](http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/uva-fraternity-sues-rolling-stone-magazine-25-million-n460316).\n\nThe fact they are fringe doesn\'t mean they aren\'t harmful. It\'s not the statistical representation that matters, but the harm done. It\'s better to think in terms of expected outcomes, as in risk. These are the combination of the probability of an event with its consequences. So a fringe position might be statistically unrepresentative, but if the consequences of the fringe actions are severe, the outcome is significantly greater than the rational positions (which are statistically more common but much less severe in consequence).\n\nHence it is the magnitude of *outcome* here that matters, not how fringe it is. This is why the rational representatives of a movement get drowned out. School policies are getting changed because of the violent and vocal fringe, as absurd as their positions are. \n\nI agree there is a problem with an attempted smear. Critics of GamerGate and MRAs smear them by portraying them based on their fringe, but the same is true of feminism, SJWs, and BLM.\n\nIslam may be a different story as I think it has largely gotten past that point. The people claiming all Muslims are terrorist are an extreme fringe themselves; the bigger confrontation is between those who criticize the *ideas* of Islam, of Islamists, and of Jihadists, and are accused of being Islamophobes. This isn\'t so much a fringe issue as it is differentiating between criticizing ideas and hating people, criticizing the sin and not the sinner, or the cancer and not the patient.

I hope we can avoid the obvious political reasons that make it difficult to implement this system. \n\nFirst, let use remember that Canada, UK, Australia - the Anglo-sphere have more in common with the US than other countries. This is important. Let us also remember that Canada, was a late adopter of universal health care - and it started with a single province and then was modified for the whole country.\n\nSecond, let us also remember, that Taiwan has a single payer healthcare system. It was actually model (and against lol) the US system - it is based on the US Medicare system except expanded for coverage of all citizens. I think it includes dental. \n\nI just want to give a quick \"global\" background for a preliminary understanding that other countries had barriers and managed to create systems through a one payer system. \n\n----------\n\n1) Your population isn\'t too big. For a one payer system, there would still be ways to manage heathcare delivery. Canada is a huge country - as you know - and it manages to provide efficient healthcare delivery by using several mechanisms.\na) Canada as a country doesn\'t do shit except ensure drugs are safe, First Nations has access, army has access to health, etc. They give money (Social-Health transfers) to the provinces and they provide health. If anything, by removing delivery by provinces - you can probably make Canada even better - but that requires a PhD dissertation on Federalism and quality healthcare. \n\nEasily, the US can implement a model similar to this - by creating organizations through medicare that directly deal with healthcare delivery services in regions. Speaking of regions, in order to mobilize inefficiencies in the system, you can create Regional Health Authorities to help \"micro-manage\" and integrate services. They would probably be intra-state. \n\nAlso - remember that healthcare delivery is still private often!\n\n2) Language, etc, is not really an issue. It just means that the government can ensure that private agencies have language/multicultural services before getting contracts. There are many ways to roll it out. \n\nAlso, the US is not really that complex genetically. I mean, England is Caribbean, African, Indian, East Asian, etc. Canada actually has two official languages, and First Nations are a priority for healthcare delivery. I don\'t mean to minimize your concern, but I feel it is a non-issue and one that is work-able!\n\n3) Although many people hate medicare - it actually is efficient. It may be much more efficient than the private sector. For one, it is most likely the leading source of quality improvement. In order to receive medicare, you have to roll out inter-operable health informatic systems, you have to ensure you practice evidence based medicine. Remember, healthcare is a system - that is homecare, LTC, hospital, physio, nurses, physicians, etc - the government is just inherently in a better position to coordinate them. \n\nThis is why the US is over-paying for medical care - healthcare is just different than the post office or trains.

For the sake of argument, lets say you\'ve convinced me that a fetus is innocent, and you\'ve convinced me that a fetus is a person, *based on your provided definitions of innocence and personhood*.\n\nNow, given that, lets talk about premise #1, \"Killing an innocent person is wrong\". In order for your conclusion to be truly logically sound, we have to be 100% sure that when we talk about whether or not we hold this premise, we\'re using *exactly* the same definitions of innocence and personhood used in premises #2 and #3. And when you look at it through this lens, what seemed at first like a totally obvious, uncontroversial premise #1, now is quite complicated and relies on a definition that you yourself have described as a completely arbitrary notion. As a matter of taxonomy, I don\'t object to anything you\'ve said in your analysis of premise #3, but given that, I absolutely will not agree to premise #1, since it necessarily is as arbitrary as the personhood definition, which you haven\'t even clearly defined. Premise #3 is just assigning a label, so I\'m fine to leave it arbitrary, but when we\'re talking about whether something is right or wrong, the arbitrary nature of the definitions doesn\'t fly.\n\nBut of course it all seems so harmless when you put premise #1 first, because it *seems* like such an obviously true facet of any moral system. If you just go an ask people about premise #1, they\'ll almost certainly agree. But if you then afterwards create an arbitrary and disputed definition of personhood, you have to revisit premise #1 in much greater detail, or else you\'ve pulled a sneaky bait and switch.\n\nThis issue is sort of a broader category of logical errors that come from relying on labels and categorization in arguments. By its very nature, choosing what to *call something*, while useful for conversation, can\'t have any actual logical implications, as its arbitrary and a mere function of language. So if your important premise can\'t stand on its own without relying on premises that are just labels, then you have to be *extremely* careful that your definitions are consistent across your logical argument. A classic example of this type of thing is \"All bats are animals\", \"Some wooden objects are bats\", ergo \"Some wooden objects are animals\". In that example, its obvious that there are two totally different uses of the word \"bat\". In your example, the problem is much more subtle, but essentially boils down to a similar problem with the use of the term \"person\".\n\nEdit: I noticed you revised your post to use \"human\" instead of \"person\". I\'m not going to go through the same effort in terms of editing, but I maintain my argument still stands.

A question your reasoning leads to is, if we had the technology to nourish and raise every conceived combination of egg and sperm, whether the abortion happens the first week or the ninth month, and the child will be adopted, or put in some beneficial institution or something... will and should every mother who takes an abortion today rather give their baby or fetus to this system? I don\'t think most will say yes to that question, and when they do I think there\'s still a nagging feeling that this \"right\" or \"acceptable\" or \"correct\" answer doesn\'t really resonate that well. Sure, a lot of kids would end up in these kinds of institutions or adoptions, and certainly all after-birth abortions should in my opinion, but not all fetuses should necessarily be. \n\nThis is because I think abortion is in some cases thought of as a ctrl-z, conceiving was unintentional, or some information was disclosed late about the terms of the pregnancy or the birth or the baby or the raising of it. If abortion is acceptable if the woman\'s life is in danger, doesn\'t that also apply if she must sacrifice the rest of her life to caring for a baby she doesn\'t want? There are many kinds of circumstances that will be impossible in combination with raising a child, or even getting one, and sacrificing a career or just 18 years of one\'s life is a major life changer, which should and does weigh heavily on the scales against the fetus\' life. At least in all cases of abortion I know about. The world was fine before the abortion, and the world was fine after the abortion, and no pregnancy was forced through by \"moral standards\" which could reduce the life satisfaction of everyone involved in the decision.\n\nSo then what about the baby, or fetus, or \"life\" that gets aborted? You talk about personhood as something someone has inside them, unique to them and apart from any influence of others. If I retreat from society to live in solitude, am I still a person? To whom? Of course I am still a person to myself, and also I am or have been a person to every other person I\'ve met, through all the ties I have to society. A baby, however, has none of these. We humans care more for our own than for strangers, or people who aren\'t part of our society. We can see this in our treatment of the animal kingdom. In the western world many have pets, and treat dogs as friends or family members, while whereas pigs may be more intelligent, we breed and kill those to eat their flesh. I like my meat, and am comfortable with the fact that a pig has died for my bacon, because this is a killing habit we humans have developed to thrive as a species, even though the pigs have done nothing wrong except being delicious. I don\'t mind this, although if we some day become able to grow bacon in the lab, I\'ll have to revise my stance on the morals of pig-killing.\n\nWhat\'s this got to do with the fetus though? We don\'t in general keep memories from before we\'re a couple of years old. So for the person themselves sake, there\'s only a potential that\'s been done away with. This means that to me, I don\'t think a baby of one year is that much closer to being a person than a fetus is. The one year old baby is to my knowledge less intelligent than both dogs and pigs, and I don\'t consider them people, in general. So why do I still think aborting a fetus is okay in most cases, while after-birth killing a baby is wrong? Because rather than defining a being through their inherent sentience, I think it is right in this case to define it through their ties to society. If you kill me, whom have you wronged? Me in some sense, but I\'m dead and won\'t think twice about it, there\'s no resentment from me. The ones you hurt is my family, my friends, anyone who depends on me through the labour I do, or the things that I know, or the services I provide. Then in a more real sense you may shake everyone\'s feelings of safety, security, if you\'re always afraid to be killed, how can you plan ahead and live a happy life?\n\nThe fetus is firstly known to, if anyone at all, the mother. Maybe the father, maybe some other people. Few if any of these contemplate a real existence of the baby, the child, and that\'s where the spectrum begins. When there\'s talk of the future of the child, it\'s become a bit more of a person. When there\'s talk of a name for it, it\'s become a bit more of a person. Whenever people feel the baby kicking, it\'s become a bit more of a person. During a regular pregnancy, by the time the baby is born, so many people has made ties with it, so while it may not be a full \"person\" yet, in terms of social ties it has gone a really long way, long enough that many people will be sad if it stops being. And for the \"after-birth abortions\", they are also wrong because if they are allowed to happen, could the baby of someone else be mistakenly killed? No one wants that, and so I think no one protests that if abortions should be allowed they must happen before birth, I hope by now it\'s clear why I brought that up in the first place.\n\nSo now, if the only person who can break a bond to the fetus thinks it is worth it, I don\'t think there\'s anything wrong with that. It\'s not about the life of the fetus, or the cells, or the prospect of a person, it\'s about the ones already living. They make the decisions for their own lives, and since the fetus is in a unique position to human life before it\'s birthed, and there\'s not always strong argument for bringing a new life to earth, there\'s no particular reason for society to protect the fetus against the mother\'s will. Then as addendum, there have always been abortions, illegal or not, and why not acknowledge it and support it, making sure it\'s done in a safe fashion. In a perfect world with perfect contraception, perfect economic support, perfect adoption services, and even perfect technology to bear forth a fetus outside of the womb, I still think abortion would exist and be legit as a ctrl-z for the mother or the parents.','3z79r4',0,0,0,0,NULL,0,0),(2,1451781542,'cyju6hi','ralph-j','r/changemyview',0,'> A foetus is violating a woman\'s bodily autonomy\n\nThat\'s not the argument. Forcing women to stay pregnant against their will is violating their bodily autonomy.\n\n> Consensual sex - if a woman chose to have sex, with or without contraception, then she consented to the possibility that she could become pregnant. She is therefore responsible for giving birth to the child.\n\nIf bodily autonomy is granted, then it applies in all equivalent scenarios. The bodily autonomy to have a foreign object removed from one\'s body does not suddenly disappear based on what the object is alleged to be.\n\n> The only way you can argue that a foetus isn\'t a person is if you create some sort of \"model\" of what a person is, and a set of attributes that you can test for.\n\nThat makes personhood a word definition issue. Under this view, it entirely depends on which characteristics one arbitrarily assigns to what it means to be a human being/person. There is no separate, discoverable truth of what it means to be *a* human or *a* person. There is no way to determine whether a fetus is indeed a human being/person, independent from the characteristics we decide on first.\n\nScience can at most tell us that a clump of cells is alive and that it is of human origin, but it cannot tell us when it becomes *a* human being, unless we first provide a definition of what that means.

Two of those major jobs are set design and costuming. Unless you have a director or producer who is incredibly picky about his or her production to the point of needing to sign off on minuscule details, the set designer and the costumer will be given general notes about what kind of clothes/set design is necessary for a given scene, and the costumer and set designer will be trusted to run with it.  \n\nOf course, people along the way with a say can veto certain things, and if a costume or set element is important for a scene there will be a production note. But it would be incredibly unlikely that a production note would be added for a costume or set accessory for something that is deemed unimportant to plot or character beats.  \n\nIn other words, this infographic is assuming that Butler went to the costume designer and demanded that the main character of the show wear a necklace with two keys in a scene she shares with a cow.

A director is not slavishly adorning his or her actors with costume elements that are unimportant to the script or the scene.

Even so, there are still secular reasons as to why abortion is justified.\n\nFirst, there is no rights claim to your body on the baby\'s part. Imagine that you are kidnapped by a society of music lovers who want to save the life of the world\'s greatest violinist. This violinist has severe kidney problems however your kidney happens to be healthy enough to support the both of you so the society manages to connect your life support to the violinist\'s. You must stay connected for 9 months otherwise the violinist will die. It\'s pretty clear that in this case EVEN IF the violinist is a) a person, b) innocent, and 3) of immense value, most people would not object to you disconnecting yourself and leaving the violinist to die. In fact, we would conclude that you CHOOSING to stay is charitable; that is, he had no rights claim to your body yet you did him a favor. Similarly, a baby\'s right to life is not a claim on your right to your own body.\n\nSecond, from a society-wide perspective, even if you might FEEL obliged to the baby it is not the case that a just society should use force to resolve this rights conflict. For example, consider the analogous case of organ harvesting. Even though there would come immense good from conscripting organs from everyone once they die whether or not the consent, the state does not in fact do that. Surely, the people on the organ waiting list probably deserve an organ and if you were on such a list you might wish that a stranger\'s rights over her own  body did not supersede your right to keep on living. Yet, you would probably not be so quick to enact your desires into law and actually start conscripting organs from strangers. Similarly, your own feeling on the issue of abortion and this rights conflict is not a sufficiently strong warrant as to why abortion should be wrong in the sense that you would will a world where everyone always acted according to your desire.\n\nAnd third, there is a meaningful distinction between killing something and letting it die. Contrast shooting a person with walking away from a seriously injured person or a doctor injecting a body with person with obliging a DNR. The former in both cases constitute a deprivation of life in the face of a prior moral obligation. The latter differ in that no one obliged you to help. Even if it were the case that you \"should\" have not abided by the DNR or \"should\" have sought out help for the injured, you were not obligated to. Doctors are free to walk away from their profession even if they know people will die. Similarly, a pregnant woman lets a baby die , but does not kill it. She had no prior obligation to the baby after all.

You can\'t murder something that is already dead, and there\'s no point going through a pregnancy for a child to simply die upon being born (as it endangers the mother for no gain). The latter is not only medically necessary, it is ethically an act of mercy rather than unjustifiable, whether or not you consider a foetus to have personhood. \n\nAs an aside on the ethical question of terminations, I\'d point to [Gisella Perl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gisella_Perl), a jewish gynocologist that performed secret terminations in the nazi camps to spare women from death (or *worse*, if you care to read about the horrors of that).

I\'m not trying to convince you that abortion is okay, but I am challenging that you\'ve presented a secular argument against it. The specific part of your post that I\'m addressing is:\n\n> I\'d like to find out if i\'ve made a mistake in framing this problem, or haven\'t properly proven one of the components\n\nYour logical argument is of the form:\n\n\"Killing an X is wrong\"\n\"A fetus is X\"\n\nAnd thus the conclusion, \"Killing a fetus is wrong\" / \"Abortion is wrong\".\n\nI see all over the 180+ comments on this thread are you and others debating over the \"A fetus is X\" part. This is total waste of time. If anyone is arguing over whether \"A fetus is X\", then you can\'t possibly have established that \"Killing an X is wrong\", so even if you convince someone that \"A fetus is X\", their previously stated beliefs on \"Killing an X is wrong\" will have changed, because when they agreed to that premise, it was based on a definition of X that didn\'t include a fetus.\n\nAt the end of the day, arguing about whether or not \"A fetus is X\" is merely taxonomy. The truth value of that classification *cannot have any moral significance*, because whatever definition of X was being used was already baked into every other premise relating to X.\n\nSo ultimately, when you strip away the \"labeling\" premises, all you actually have is the single, highly disputed premise that \"Killing a fetus is wrong\". And if there\'s a secular argument in favor of this, you haven\'t made it here. Any attempt at an argument of the form \"A fetus is X\" / \"Killing an X is wrong\" is just obfuscation. It\'s pulling a bait and switch of getting people to agree to your first premise, but then when you argue for your other two premises, you\'re altering meaning of the first premise, which depends on the same definitions.\n\nFor me, I don\'t care what we call things. I\'m okay to grant you for the sake of argument that a fetus is an innocent human person. But  then *using those definitions* I flatly reject the claim that \"Killing an innocent human person is wrong\". If after a hundred posts back and forth, you convince the other posters in this thread to use your definition of \"innocent human person\" such that it includes a fetus, they will do the same, and you\'ll have accomplished nothing.\n\nTo reiterate the general problem with your argument: This issue is sort of a broader category of logical errors that come from relying on labels and categorization in arguments. By its very nature, choosing what to call something, while useful for conversation, can\'t have any actual logical implications, as its arbitrary and a mere function of language. So if your important premise can\'t stand on its own without relying on premises that are just labels, then you have to be extremely careful that your definitions are consistent across your logical argument. A classic example of this type of thing is \"All bats are animals\", \"Some wooden objects are bats\", ergo \"Some wooden objects are animals\". In that example, its obvious that there are two totally different uses of the word \"bat\". In your example, the problem is much more subtle, but essentially boils down to a similar problem with the use of the term \"innocent human person\".','3z79r4',1,0,1,1,NULL,0,0),(1,1451812203,'cyk89ki','[deleted]','r/changemyview',0,'I think Fry\'s description is more specific, and more enlightening, and Walker\'s almost just sort of sounds like a quip itself rather than an actual thought.\n\nI can also think of a load of shows that match fry\'s description perfectly off the top of my head, and with Walker\'s I\'d have to really stretch since the meaning isn\'t clear.\n\nFor Fry, consider: Married with children, Archer, It\'s Always Sunny, Arrested Development, Parks and Recreation.

Where you\'ve messed up is where you just completely glossed over the notion of personhood, proposing an answer without any argument.\n\nTo get to the root of personhood we cannot take shortcuts; we must think outside the box and ask ourselves: in the practice of ethics (see footnote), for what *purpose* do we assign the label of \"living person/human\" to a thing? Answer: we use it as a linguistic shortcut to help us efficiently confront ethical challenges, such that when things are granted that label they are considered to have certain \"rights\" or inviolable sacred properties. We choose to assign those objects those properties because such assignment helps us construct the world we want to live in (see: Kant\'s Categorical Imperative). So it boils down to this: do you want to live in a world where when you get pregnant you are anchored to a life-altering responsibility that you may have to face entirely on your own, to the chagrin of all of society (see: Gladwell\'s statistical conclusion that unwanted babies disproportionately grow up to be criminals) and the chagrin of taxpayers and everyone who could\'ve benefitted from existing alongside a woman who has control of her own life and can plan her family decisions, a world in which those same troubled women are forced to seek unsafe underground abortions, where a man can squirt a baby into a woman and leave knowing he is perfectly safe and the whole thing is her problem now? Or: do we want to live in a world where the moral implications of an act are considered best analyzed by the person closest to the act and most responsible for its cause and its consequences; where everyone benefits from reproductive choices that are indeed *choices* (i.e. intentional)?\n\nOn my phone; sorry for run-on sentences.\n\nFootnote: we can think in terms of *ethics* or *morals* or *law*, and each will lead us to a potentially different conclusion. For instance I might morally consider a fetus a person based on how my morality/religion works, and that would affect my personal decisions; ethically, I would have to agree with the above arguments and say a fetus is *not* a person; legally, I\'d say it makes the most sense for us to live in a society where a fetus is not considered a person, since such a definition makes the law more consistent, executable, and more in line with the societal relations our government is meant to enforce.

Short of getting us out of the perils of philosophical investigation, this demarcation invoked by reminders of mortality are the best we can do to let our minds settle and actually be at peace with ourselves.\n\nThus, it\'s not so much that people seek immortality or transcendence, it\'s quite the opposite.

Can you show me a single instance where something was rejected from the academic or scientific literature simply for being “offensive”, rather than because of the perceived credibility of the work itself?  This would strengthen your argument.\n\n3. Frankly, this argument sounds familiar to creationists who argue they’re being “censored” from the scientific literature and can’t even join the debate.  I don’t feel that reasoned debate mandates all ideas are given equal airtime.  I doubt any of the people who want to “teach the controversy” over creationism in science class get upset that there’s not equal time dedicated to “Ancient Aliens”.  Discredited or unsupported ideas are not strengthened just because the mainstream does not constantly go out of way to engage them, especially if they’ve been discredited in the past / in other venues.\n\n4. Again on the point that Reddit’s not the intellectual community at large : Posters of these so-called “offensive” ideas gather together and post copypasta propaganda all the time on social media sites.  However, most people aren’t there to debate this stuff, and may not even be qualified to do so.  However, the average layperson may not be qualified to debate the nuances of carbon dating techniques, but most know enough to know that dinosaurs and neanderthals existed and that the earth is not 5,000 years old or that there were T-Rexes on a giant wooden ark.  Once again, people not giving headspace to obviously nonsensical or discredited ideas does not mean people are afraid to entertain them.\n\n5. I actually do regularly see people engage with these ideas in debate even on Reddit.  When racist copypasta gets posted, I see people engaging.  They point out when statistics are taken out of context or point out that there are other factors at play or other conclusions you can draw from the data.  And more often than not I see the original poster respond back with the usual “Why are you getting so mad?  I’m just stating facts” regardless of the tone of the response, or the ever entertaining “Look how intolerant these so called liberals are!”  My subjective, anecdotal experience of discussions on Reddit / online in general differs from yours, so I’m not sure how to convince you on this point other than to say that just because you can find examples where people don’t engage intellectually doesn’t mean it doesn’t happen, or that there’s not valid counter arguments (as addressed in my other points).\n\n6. Minor point, but in your intro you say “just like the intellectuals of the day tossed out the heliocentric model…”.  I always thought of the opposition as being from the church rather than the scientific community of the era.  Before I posted in response I actually skimmed the Wikipedia articles on Copernicus and the heliocentric model to double check this.  While its true that other astronomers did write works against the heliocentric model, works published in opposition (such as Francesco Ingoli’s letter to Galileo, which was believed to be influential in the church’s decision to reject Copernican theory) used physical, mathematical, and theological arguments.  While these arguments obviously did not hold up with time, it’s false to say that the intellectual community dismissed the ideas simply because they were “un-christian” or offensive.  In contrast, my reading of the situation is that, despite *actual* censorship from the church, and the fact that the entire current understanding of the field of physics needed to be revised as a result, the idea gradually gained acceptance.  You present this example in your intro seemingly to make a claim of a historical trend in the intellectual community of ignoring facts, when instead your example actually points to the opposite, of the scientific and intellectual community having the willingness to change over time with new data, even if it means discarding a large amount of what they had previously considered as truth.  It’s not critical to your overall argument but it comes across as an attempt to deride the intellectual community as being historically “closed minded”.  \n\n7. The comparison with the geocentric universe is spurious for several other reasons.  First of all, you are making an analogy to the rejection of new ideas based on objective fact in lieu of the status quo, based on faith, or what people “want” to believe, as a way to support your argument.  Racism, xenophobia, homophobia, etc were all once the status quo.  Sometimes they had the backing of the scientific and intellectual community, (the popularity of eugenics, phrenology) but then, like in the case of the geocentric universe, the ideas were discredited and rejected because better models of the world were developed that better fit known facts.  I doubt many treatises are written these days debunking geocentrism.\n\n8. Finally, and most importantly, you are conflating factual with ethical and subjective claims.  Racism, homophobia, xenophobia, etc. are ugly tribal prejudices whose proponents occasionally attempt to justify them retroactively with facts.  Even taken in the most charitable light, in the best possible case, we’re talking about implementations of particular political platforms or personal behavior / treatment of others based on these alleged facts.  Therefore you can simply dismiss bigotry outright because ethics and personal behavior aren’t “facts” to be uncovered.  Examples from my personal morality: I believe in the Bill of Rights and the ideals it represents.  Therefore, any pleas that Muslims are all the great Satan who want to destroy America doesn’t make me want mass surveillance of Americans or discrimatory laws against Muslims, no matter how many facts they bring to the table.  This is because I love liberty more than I’m a coward.  I’m not unwilling to hear facts, but it’s simply the case that I don’t possess a moral framework that leads from any set of facts to wanting to implement a political platform that discriminates based on race or religion.\n\nPostscript: “The goal of any debate or any modern, civilized culture should be to find truth”   I disagree with this assertion because of the above point.  This presumes either everything can be solved as an objective truth, or that things that can’t aren’t worth discussion.  Debate can help us refine our own viewpoint, or to understand someone else’s even if we have irreconcilably opposing worldviews.  \n','3z7r3u',0,0,0,0,NULL,0,0),(0,1451822589,'cykan67','[deleted]','r/changemyview',0,'Watch the rest of his videos before you judge him for what little you\'ve seen.

Harm caused to other people is one exception, and harm to others who are not human but are of other species. There are also cases where someone is not attempting to harm, but is doing so without intent. This is a grey area and in some cases the person can be morally killed to spare others, even though their intent was not to kill others. An example would be someone who thinks that they can save people by releasing a biological agent, this would reduce population but would be killing of many people and grounds for termination, even if they had the best of intentions. Another would be someone who is ignorant of the effects of their actions and therefore may cause drastic harm and there is no other way to stop them. \n\nSo, my version of your conclusion would be \"Killing another human being who is not going to cause harm is generally wrong\". This is relatively weak, but I can say I agree with this statement directly and that the nuance was missing from your original statement. \n\nAs for the two premises above, this is where things get complicated. \n\nI agree with premise 1, being that foetuses do not intend to cause harm. This is because I am not convinced they could have an awareness of the likelihood of their actions leading to harm. They are not developed enough to have this awareness until they are a few years of age after birth, so at no time are they able to make informed decisions and therefore have no moral accountability for their actions. \n\nThis leads us to the question of whether it is relevant whether the actions are intended or not. If I drive my car there is a chance that even if I drive perfectly someone could step out in front of my car without looking. I am aware of this risk but still drive. Am I intending to kill someone? No, I have evaluated the risk and consider it small enough to drive without guilt about that potential end. In this case the fault would either be unable to attribute or lie with the victim. This is morally equivalent for the foetus in my mind. The foetus did not choose to be there, hanging out in a woman\'s womb, but they could cause harm by their presence. If I am going to cause harm it is appropriate to stop me, if the foetus is causing harm it is appropriate to stop it. But this does not really address the core of the issue here, the issue is not just about physical harm. \n\nIf I was to kidnap someone, tattoo them, brand them, and deprive them of adequate nutrition for 9 months, this would be seen as a serious infringement of their rights. It would be criminal, and while I would not be killed for it, I could certainly be accidentally killed in the process of police rescuing the victim. This would happen regardless of whether I was doing it for personal pleasure or because of a mental illness. This is a breach of the victim\'s rights, including the right to free movement, bodily autonomy, and health. \n\nIf a foetus has the same effects, and both of us are not morally accountable, then what exactly is the difference? To be even more direct, what about vampires? They act without permission, cause some small physical harm, and do it to sustain their own life. There is a risk that they could cause a death, and they could spread disease, not to mention they are violating the rights of their victims. Is there any meaningful distinction between a foetus and a vampire? \n\nLastly, your point about foetuses being human. I will quote you directly. \n\n>Humanity - the accepted, scientific litmus test to determine whether something is a member of a particular species is to determine whether the thing in question is an independent organism (in the most basic sense, not independent as in \"can survive outside the womb\" sense) AND whether it is genetically a member of the species in question. This test eliminates the sperm cell and skin cell reductio ad absurdum arguments:\n\n>A sperm cell only contains half of the genetic information required for it to be considered human\n\n>A Skin cell isn\'t an independent organism, it is part of a larger organism\n\nThis definition means that people who have Down\'s syndrome are not human. This also means that some cancers are human as they live without the original host (in labs etc) and are genetically a match. \n\nAnother question is chimeras. Chimeras are usually formed by having the failed separation of a dual-impregnation egg, one which would have normally generated non-identical twins. If the cells never properly separate you get a mixed organism, one which has two separate genetic codes. In all likelihood it would be about 75% identical between the two halves, so the same ratio as with non-identical twins, but it would function as a single organism. Is this a single human? Is this two humans? 1.25? \n\nThe definition is vague and therefore not very useful. The other interpretation which many people go for is self sustaining, meaning it\'s vital functions will continue for a time if severed from the parent. A zygote will not survive, nor will an early stage foetus. Our ability to sustain life in an early stage foetus has increased, but at 20 weeks the odds are still very grim. A full 40 weeks is the best time frame for a reasonable pregnancy, and that means you are looking at some bad options for early delivery. \n\nIf you deliver at 20 weeks you will either get a stunted person, a reasonably healthy person, or a dead person. If you abort you will definitely get a dead person. The moral details here are important. If a stunted person, one who will suffer immeasurably, will live a short life and have limited options for what to do with it, is this better or worse than death? \n\nSo I think we\'ve covered most of the issues, but there is one which is extremely important which we have not touched on, the concept of autonomy. We grant certain freedoms to individuals based on a few core concepts, and one which seems to be the base of many others is autonomy, specifically bodily autonomy. We don\'t allow you to restrict the movement of others without legal grounds, we don\'t allow you to use another person\'s body without their permission, and we allow individuals to make their own medical decisions even though they are really bad at it. We do this because we respect the fact that a person comes into this world with their mind and their body. \n\nImagine that a person was to be driving, let\'s say drink driving to make the moral situation more clear, and they hit a person, no, a small child, with their car, causing a great deal of harm to the child. Let\'s imagine the child is picked up by the ambulance, taken to hospital, and just barely kept alive. The doctors determine that without a replacement kidney the child will die soon, and they have a very rare blood type which is hard to get an organ replacement for. \n\nShould the driver, who is clearly morally culpable in this case, have to give a kidney to save the child? Can we force them? I would argue no, it would be a breach of their rights to do so and we would not forcefully take a kidney in this case. \n\nIn the case of a pregnant woman, their autonomy is at stake. If they have decided to take on a pregnancy then they are choosing to donate the use of their organs, as well as taken on the risks associated with pregnancy. If they did not choose directly to take on a pregnancy then they should be able to make their own decision about whether or not to continue supporting another life with their own organs. If we take that right away we are forcing the driver to donate a kidney, we are saying that the mother has no autonomy and forcing her to use her body as an incubator.

Divorce rates are at an all time high, less people are getting married and there really seems to be less and less benefits to such a union as society continually changes. \n\nI think this could be relatively true except that traditional values keep the \"institution of marriage\" going. Also, with the advent of gay marriage more than ever in the United States, this is also reinforcing the marriage institution. At the same time, people who are single and are not in marriages seem to be experiencing less stigma. \n\n> Marriage as a concept was essentially a system to help the human species survive. It provided children support from both parents, it provided women a guarantee of support from a husband and insured men that the women they are dedicating their support is exclusive. This system worked in time when there was less safety overall (both health and physical) and seemed generally okay.\n\nHmm, I guess you could say that except that it only came with ancient civilizations. Hence, the human race was surviving before marriage and could hypothetically survive without it.\n\n> Society has however increased it\'s standards drastically. Safety is less of an issue and the roles of both genders has changed drastically. The foundations of what has made marriage a viable model has been completely changed yet the model itself has had very little done to it itself (outside of allowing more people to use it). As it stands, it\'s a tool that addresses the flaws of a past society but is now becoming a flaw in the current now.\n\nPerhaps the definition of marriage has changed. One could say this even reflected in shows such as South Park that have one main character from a single home in contrast to The Simpsons which has a nuclear family, a \"traditional\" family of a husband and wife.\n\n> As it stands, it\'s bounding people longer than it has before (due to increases in how long people live along with societies changing of how it treats relationships), it is designed as a support system for one person who doesn\'t provide revenue when a majority of marriages have both doing so (leading to some very unfair divorce settlements), and the support of the child has been steadily growing towards single parents due to the failures of marriage as it stands.\n\nI agree with the bounding people for too long. To me to seems that marriage is almost like a long-term investment but that the returns from that investment aren\'t always evident. Additionally it may be dated because as you note above, divorce statements, but also that it is \"till death do us part.\" I personally have been thinking for some time now that the idea of temporary marriage could solve problems with marriage. Perhaps just having different forms of relationships or being single could avoid these problems as well.\n\n> I just don\'t see how marriage is really in anyway addressing any of the issues that relationships have in today\'s society and through it trying to solve issues of the past society creates new ones in our current one. So is there something I\'m missing in how the current system is working to benefit people that shows the concept doesn\'t need addressing?\n\nYou make a good point. I also don\'t think that marriage is necessarily solving relationship problems. But I would also say that it is not really solving social problems either. I also think that many people are pressured into marriage by society at-large when it isn\'t right for them. Just like other institutions, marriage is right for some people and not for others. If there is a healthy and loving relationship between two people with marriage, then that\'s good. But I don\'t think this is the norm and that instead there are other goals at play. Hence, marriage creates more problems in society. \n\nI thank you for posting this because I got to think about this more.

This is the lion\'s share of the issue.\n\nAt the end of the day, an abortion is linked to sex in a pretty dire way. The idea that abortion is a moral wrong to be avoided implies almost unavoidably that there is such a thing as a consensual sex act between adults which is immoral and condemnable. Frankly, this is TNT for most people, and women in particular. That\'s also why \'considering what the other side of saying\' is psychological torment for the pro-choicers. \n\n\'Entertain the possibility that your sexual decisions are immoral.\' \'Entertain the possibility that you\'re engaging in murder, particularly murder of your own child or encouraging someone to murder their own child, in their most innocent and helpless state.\'\n\nYou have to jump through extreme limit cases to get anything comparable with pro-lifers - \'Imagine that it\'s an 11 year old pregnant girl who was raped repeatedly by her father and the child is likely going to die anyway and she will definitely die if she has the child and also she\'s poor\' and a good share of them will say \'Sure, in that case, it can go either way. Now let\'s talk about the other vast majority of cases which aren\'t comparable and involve thoughtless choices or selfishness.\'\n\nFor a pro-choicer to recognize their opponents have a good point and the situation is nuanced is to set themselves up for defeat. Particularly in the US, where legally you can axe your child at any stage of pregnancy, which even a substantial number of \'pro-choice\' people find deplorable. Rhetorically, pro-lifers -must- be utterly irrational crazy zealots without an inkling of a reasonable leg to stand on, because if that rhetoric is lost, so too is a good share of their defense. This is not an issue they can afford to be treat as \'it\'s possible to be open-minded about it\'.\n\nAnyway, the short of it is: nuance and reasonable people exist, but the value of either side - particularly the pro-choice side - publicly accepting as much is too politically high.','40vmxx',0,0,0,0,NULL,0,0),(1,1452757937,'cyxp8gr','IIIBlackhartIII','r/changemyview',0,'As to your point about a bundle of cells... that\'s exactly what they are until a point. When you clean your house do you worry about using anti-bacterial substances to kill single or multi-cellular organisms? Are you a person with any issues about killing a bug that gets in your house? The argument really has to come to sentience, intelligence, autonomy... Because until that growing bundle of cells starts to develop a nervous system and brain, it really is nothing but growing cells. Cancer is a bundle of growing cells in a human body, but we don\'t have issue getting rid of those. Objectively and scientifically that is what they are, and though the debate of personhood has a lot deep philosophical implications, for myself and for all practical purposes, until about 22-25 weeks (the end of the first trimester and beginning of the second) into the gestation of the fetus the nervous system has not developed, and it cannot react to outside stimulus. Though the brain has formed in a rudimentary way before this, the connections between the cortex and the nerve endings developing in the body haven\'t been established. There are some fibres building, but that\'s about it. There\'s no autonomous action, no intelligence or thought, it really is just stem cells taking shape. Beyond that point, when the nervous system is solidifying and the infant can react to outside stimulus such as pain, I can agree with you there is an issue of personhood and sentient life. Before this point, it is arbitrary where you draw the line for \"personhood\". Are you of the opinion that \"every sperm is sacred\" and masturbation is genocide? Do you realise how many millions and billions of eggs and sperm are \"wasted\" every minute of the day because our body cells naturally die and get replaced? \n\nI see the \"bundle of cells\" argument to be one of the few that has no subjective mess. Is objectivity controversial? Yes. But it sits as a direct foil to the Pro-Life demonisation of murdering babies, which as you have said is a purely emotional and subjective statement. And here\'s the main point- after the first trimester it becomes increasingly risky to both mother and child to have an abortion, 91% of abortions are done in the first trimester for this reason. So the objective argument about developing cells really should hold more weight. You cannot \'murder\' something without personhood, without sentience or intelligence. If you\'re arguing instead for the \"chance\" to develop into life, then you yourself are moving away from a more objective and moderate stance and more towards a pro-life standpoint classifying life from an arbitrary point of conception.

If you want to know who someone in former Yugoslavia hates, don’t look at the Indonesians or the Zulus or the Tibetans or anyone else distant and exotic. Find the Yugoslavian ethnicity that lives closely intermingled with them and is most conspicuously similar to them, and chances are you’ll find the one who they have eight hundred years of seething hatred toward.\n\nSo.. My position is:\n\nIntolerance in the form of negative actions towards the intolerant is not hypocritical and not a moral grandstanding, **as long as** the intolerant actually does (i.e. action) something wrong (especially legally, but a strong case can also be made about morally). \"The intolerant\" is not an outgroup. It\'s what we call a bunch of people that have crossed the moral/legal boundaries.\n\nIntolerance in the form of feelings, in turn, is acceptable, towards people whose intolerance is merely in the form of feelings *or worse*. \"I hate bigots\" is not a moral grandstanding because those bigots hate people because those people are an outgroup, while the speaker hates bigots because they committed a moral transgression.\n\nBut if we commit violence towards people who (only) hates gays, that\'s where it\'s hypocritical.\n\nI\'m not really sure about intolerance in the form of a moral stance, because then we\'d be talking about a moral stance (i.e. whether or not it\'s moral grandstanding) of a moral stance (i.e. that bigotry is wrong) of a moral stance (i.e. that being gay is immoral).

Life is a lot like the games these researchers use.\n\nIn a first encounter, be cooperative (i.e. tolerant/trusting/friendly). In later encounters cooperate if the other player just cooperated, and punish if they were uncooperative. Be ready to go back to cooperating as soon as they do, and be ready to punish defection with equal (or nearly equal) swiftness and surety.

Then it became the official religion of Rome: a violent, racist, expansionist empire (not dissing Rome, those characteristics are true of any successful empire). Christianity changed as a result.

If we\'re talking about the state of race relations, then obviously it is helpful to analyze the history of exploitation of former slave races. If we\'re talking about the concept of slavery in general, no one is blaming China\'s use of slaves on Africa or vice-versa. Consider that your perspective as a person in western civilization may be coloring your view on the issue. For instance, I am not familiar at all with the concept of Chinese slaves because I grew up in the United States and when people talk about slavery, I assume they are talking about African chattel slavery in early America unless stated otherwise. We can recognize the human rights violations of our past without patting ourselves on the back that we\'re the first to abolish.\n\nOn homosexuality, I have never heard that the west being \"blamed\" for intolerance of other sexualities world wide. What I have heard is people talking about the history of western civilization as a contributor to the problem within their specific culture.

Nobody rational claims that Saudi Arabia\'s intolerance of homosexuality as a product of western civilization.\n\nSomething that people do blame western civilization for is the history of colonialism, and it can be reasonable to see how some problems worldwide come from the inequities of that practice.

Being analytical and information centric is a stereotypical \"male\" thing to do. So when you want to describe how one feels about something this can be made to be analytical in nature.\n\nFor example if I was asked \"How do you feel about being dumped?\" I would simply state that it made me feel like I was mischaracterizing my abilities to judge someone else and myself and that it stressed me out with respect to choosing another partner in the future. In essence it enhanced my feelings of self-doubt (among other things omitted to keep the example short).\n\nI don\'t think anyone would view this as un-masculine description of their emotional state. What needs to change is men\'s *interest* in other men\'s emotions to create a peer network for emotional support. Most men are accepting of their friends emotional hardships, they just aren\'t interested, which creates strong barriers for working through them that women don\'t tend to face.\n\nFor physical displays of emotion I think there is usually no opposition to men showing emotion. With the small exceptions of depression/anxiety/fear/confusion it is already \"accepted\" for men to display their emotions. Anger, disappointment, frustration, happiness, excitement, love, lust, confidence, exhaustion, skepticism, understanding, caring, etc. are all emotional states where most guys I know don\'t feel uncomfortable showing physical manifestations within reason (e.g. not punching a hole in the wall when angry). \n\nThe 4 exceptions I listed are definitely serious and unfortunately tend to be viewed as non-masculine. At the risk of committing bad psychology I would venture it stems from the fact that women like happy, confident, brave, and intelligent men. The 4 exceptions are the opposite of their respectively listed emotions. Showing any of them usually results in needing a compensating differential (to use an economics term) to attract a mate. I don\'t think it\'s in the best interest of many men to open up about these things unless they are already in a serious relationship so even if society was accepting, the incentives to mask them are strong. Within male hierarchies there are also benefits to displaying these qualities.  \n\nThe female analogy is make-up. Even with the recent push towards being accepting of no make-up most women still wear make-up either to attract a man, or because it simply makes other people treat them better, or other benefits to looking better.\n\nTL;DR Men need to show more interest in other men\'s emotions (irrespective of acceptance). Showing acceptance of vulnerabilities women do not find attractive does not resolve the fundamental incentive to hide unattractive features from potential partners/spouses/peers.','46502o',1,0,3,2,NULL,0,0),(2,1455668271,'d02ku5o','Personage1','r/changemyview',0,'So to start, I think it\'s interesting that you mention the civil rights movement and feminism in this cmv yet have the general conclusion you do.  For the civil rights movement, black people didn\'t sit around and go \"we aren\'t going to do this until white people have already shown us how it\'s done.\"  Feminists didn\'t sit around and say \"we won\'t fight for suffrage until men have already started doing so for us.\"  However now that you are looking at men\'s issues, you think it isn\'t men that needs to take the lead on this?\n\nand this isn\'t to say that male feminists can\'t or shouldn\'t do more to take the lead on this, I think we can and should, but I also think it\'s a little questionable to judge feminism for this when it\'s pretty safe to say that the majority of feminists are and especially have been women.\n\nNow as for the pushback from feminists, and in particular ideas like \"male tears.\"  I first think some of this is a pretty understandable reaction to things like the mra. We are starting to delve into too much of a tangent here so I\'ll just say this, I and most feminists feel that the mra is a toxic group that at absolutely best, brings up issues that technically are male issues, but then fails spectacularly in the analysis and follow through on actually addressing those issues. A good deal of the \"male tears\" mentality is in direct response to this, a group of primarily men who misattribute men\'s issues on feminists, and try to spread misogyny while claiming to be a victim.\n\nWhether you agree with my view of mras is immaterial and I have no desire to debate it (it\'s just too exhausting).  However, I hope that you have the capacity to imagine how you would react if you held the same opinion, and see that joking about male tears is one way to make light of something that is so frustrating.\n\nHowever there is no question that people not in on the joke will be turned off by it, and further no question that plenty of men, women, and specifically feminists who don\'t just see it as a joke but would actually laugh at the idea of men needing to address their issues. This leads to my final point.  So what?  Women were literally beaten, raped, and killed fighting for their rights.  Black people in America faced similar treatment.  If you find this goal to be important enough, it wouldn\'t matter that there are people making jokes about you, you would fight on.  If you come here and complain that other people aren\'t fighting for you, and you hesitate to fight because of \"male tears\" merchandise, I have trouble thinking that your goal is to actually get things done.','46502o',1,0,17,2,NULL,0,0),(4,1455726832,'d03bwew','namename77','r/changemyview',0,'Change doesn\'t happen in a \"results first, effort later\" direction.

It\'s allowing men to to be \"weak\" instead of having to be percieved as \"strong\". I feel like the strong/weak or dominant/submissive duality is the true heart of what causes a lot (if not all) gender problems.\n\nNote as well that this duality is so strong is because it is meant to me mutually exclusive. Men are meant to be dominant/strong becuse women allegedly not be so.\n\nYou say that there is nothing being done to break down these walls but if you watch a lot of movies lately then you will find that a lot of the gender stereotypes are being broken on a regular basis with female protagonists who are shown to be strong independent women and men who feel emotion.\n\nLet\'s take particular notice that when women are empowered then men are relieved of their burdens whether or not they know it. i.e. If a woman is shown that is capable of taking care of herself then the pressure of men to take care of them is shattered. Some men will fight to keep the status quo because it is all they know. Indeed, as I am sure as you will awknowledge, some men will fight to keep the system which hurts them as much as it does because they don\'t know any better.\n\nNote that it is difficult to change someone\'s mind once they have made it up. Older people who have been taught for years what it means to be a man will be hard pressed to resign that definition. That being said, young people are growing up in an age where movies, games, books and other forms of media where gener stereotypes are being questioned. Here are some examples\n\n* Harry Potter\n* Star Wars: The Force Awakens\n* Pokemon\n\nIf you wonder why then you can ask. This post is getting long and the proof is there if you look for it. Especially with Harry Potter.\n\nWhile I am on the point of Star Wars. Let\'s ignore how the protagonist is a female who can take care of herself. There is the reason why I think [everyone has such a problem with Kylo Ren](http://img.ifcdn.com/images/f1651442f3317356f5147196026e977670369f5af83652bc899e34ac97a59d09_1.jpg). He\'s so emotionaly unstable/fragile that people percieve him as a massive crybaby when for once we are seeing on screen a man who is in a time of great vulnerability (see adolescence) and is under huge pressure to make the \"right\" choices. For once we see a man who is afraid that he will never be as strong as he wants to be and does not completely believe in himself. We are not used to seeing this and so many people react badly to it. This is proof that things are being done to challenge the status quo.\n\nSo, I think if you pay attention you can see a lot of challenging of gender stereotypes in a lot of different highly regarded forms of media today. It\'s there if you look for it. Indeed, the next generation is going to grow up with these messages. Old masculine stereotypes are fading out. \n\nChange comes slowly though and I think your expectations are that it\'ll come much faster than it ever could. If you look back a decade you\'ll see that a lot of things in terms of gender has changed. If you look into the future one decade, you will see the same thing.

Society would be fine with expressive men, it won\'t be fine with men (or anyone really) demanding their emotions be acknowledged, that\'s never going to happen. What it will do is make it easier for anyone interested to make decisions he\'ll like that\'ll include him in the future.

In this case the fisherman and the potato farmer each represent both demand and supply: you can regard the fisherman as the person defining \"demand\" for potatoes and \"supply\" for fish, while the potato farmer defines \"demand\" for fish and \"supply\" for potatoes. When the farmer and the fisherman agree on a trade, you can look at their economic relation in many different ways with equal validity.

The problem is that people in the real world do not live 100% of their economic lives in the precise moment of exchange. Instead they spend much of their time trying to anticipate *future* exchanges, as well as learning lessons (sometimes painful, sometimes costly) from past exchanges. Economics too doesn\'t have the luxury of focusing on the moment of exchange, but must try and understand the patterns of prediction and anticipation that shape future exchanges.  Say\'s Law says that when producers anticipate future supply needs, in aggregate their future supply *always* produces demand enough to meet the supply. Is this *always* true? \n\n1. **Great Depression Unemployment**. During the height of the depression, unemployment in the US reached 25%. 1 of every 4 Americans capable of working and looking for work could not find employment. Labor is a commodity whose price is set by supply and demand just like any other commodity. If Say\'s Law is true, then a large surplus of available supply of labor like that should have produced an equivalent demand, yet this did not happen. Unemployment continued for years. Why? Well, maybe there was some kind of structural dislocation in the market; perhaps the skills of laborers were mismatched to the types of labor manufacturers were demanding. But this doesn\'t seem to be the case. The US was still primarily agricultural in the 1930s, and there were millions of skilled farmers and ranch hands who couldn\'t find work, even though there were tens of millions of acres of farms and ranches that could have been worked. Unemployed millwrights and steelworkers were right there in mill towns living next to shuttered mills. Autoworkers and other skilled factory employees waited in line for hours only to be turned away from factories producing the minimum output. Why didn\'t Say\'s Law kick in to help those workers? Why didn\'t the excess supply of skilled employees not produce an equivalent demand for their skills? \n\n2. **Buggy Oversupply**. In the 1920s everyone had a Ford, but the Featherlight Coach Company kept on producing horse-drawn coaches, wagons, buggies and the like. At some point late in the decade, Featherlight found itself on the verge of bankruptcy because it was sitting on a back inventory of 4000 coaches that it couldn\'t sell. America was really and truly switching over to the automobile, and the buggy makers found themselves to their astonishment going out of business. Say would be astonished too. How is it possible that an oversupply of buggies could exist in the first place? How is it possible that the supply of buggies didn\'t produce an equivalent demand for buggies? After all, Featherlight wasn\'t *hoarding* buggies. They\'d produced them to sell! They were finely made, luxurious buggies any horse would feel proud to pull. Why wouldn\'t they sell? \n\n3. **Investment Glut**. It\'s pretty widely accepted that the global financial markets today are experience a \"savings glut\" or \"investment glut\". The basic notion is that there are large accumulations of capital that are sloshing around the global financial sector looking for suitable and secure returns on investment... and not finding them. In other words, there is an oversupply of capital or equivalently a lack of demand for capital. In economic terms, this is because the economies of most countries in the world are recessionary or experiencing slow recovery and slow growth after the Financial Crisis. Businesses are not producing, and therefore investments in businesses offer low returns. According to Say\'s Law, the \"excess\" of investment capital should not exist in the first place, because generating the supply of that capital should also generate adequate demand for that capital. Yet this does not appear to be happening. Instead there are signs of excess capital... like flight to the dollar which is keeping US inflation low, indications of new speculative investment bubbles in the financial markets, etc. How do you explain these signs of \"investment pressure\" or \"investment glut\" in terms of Say\'s Law?

After all, they grow up in wildly different times with very different influences. Theres almost a 100% chance they\'ll  try to be independent and rebellious during the teenager phase. This is because teenagers have a need for being recognised as adults even if they are not fully developed yet. Having different opinions and values is part of the whole seperation from the parent idea so that they become their own person. Developing original ideas is normal and even healthy for a teenager.\n\nThe interesting thing about humans is that we repeat similar mistakes every generation, nature has made it so that we painstakingly redo every dumb mistake that our parents made. While this seems really inefficient, this means that our kids are able to adapt to a changing world. Because not everything stays the same and old advice is not always going to be the right way. Imagine all the times when millenials complain about advice we recieved from our parents. Things such as \"work hard and you\'ll get somewhere\". This advice was developed in a time when the markets were healthy and booming. Meanwhile, after the crash in 2008 resources are scarce and employers cant and wont employ just anyone. Even those who are qualified. A uni degree, while still a good investment, is not the end all be all anymore like it used to be. There is no such thing as a safe job anymore. Even engineers sometimes have trouble finding jobs.\n\nWhat I want to illustrate is that we live in a very different world from our parents and so maybe it\'s good that we are able to develop our own opinions and strategies instead of just rehashing everything that came before us.

Survival.\n\nA lot of cultural values reflect the technological and environmental context of the time of their adoption. They arose at a time when they worked, and many are discarded over time as the situation changes.\n\nIt could certainly be argued that certain values are a luxury allowed by favourable circumstance, unviable in harsher times.\n\nWhat I\'m getting at is that many values are really just *tools for survival*. Others are *tools for progress*, but these (obviously) trump tools for survival, because you can\'t progress if you don\'t survive.\n\nSo, it\'s important that values are malleable over generational time, to allow for (ideally) progress, but most importantly to allow for survival under changing circumstances.\n\nBehavioural flexibility is the key to the success and continuance of the human race. It\'s what has allowed us to persist and dominate over an astonishingly broad spectrum of environments and circumstances, throughout hundreds of thousands of years and almost the entire globe.\n\nWould you agree that the survival of your children is a greater priority than their being an effective continuation of you in terms of behavioural rules?\nIf so, this is a partial modification of your stated CMV. If not, if it\'s a case of \"better dead than red!\", then it must be the case that *the primary purpose* of children, to you, is to continue your values. Which seems very limiting.\n\nSecondly: Progress.\n\nFrom our perspective, when looking at the last few thousand years of history, it appears that there has been, on average and on the whole, a gradual improvement in things we currently hold to be good things.\n\nCertainly any one of is can find *some* point in history when things were done differently, and say \"our values are better than those values (even if only made possible by better circumstances)\".\n\nOne can thus say that we have made progress in that specific area/value, even if not in others.\n\nIf children always had the values of their predecessors, no improvement could ever be made.

These desires are driven by natural selection; those who didn\'t have this genetic predisposition didn\'t reproduce as often as those that did by the very nature of the desire itself (to reproduce). That means the genes that cause the desire show up more often in a population than alternative genes (alleles) that don\'t.\n\nOn the cognitive side, purely choosing to have children or not could be for a lot of reasons. On what basis does reproducing your values serve you? You have those values, but what do you care of the values of people after you die? You might (arrogantly) say that your values make people happier and you want your children to be happier, ergo they must share your values, but this is circular.

What you want is the *expected value* of the outcome to exceed the *expected cost*. Expected value and cost are calculated as the multiplication of the consequence (importance) of the value with its probability of occurring, and same for expected cost. If you sum all expected values and subtract all expected costs, and end up with a positive value, then going forward with it is expected to be a net positive.\n\nFinally, your position is ultimately self-defeating.

A human in that situation would have other options. \n\nHumans learn and develop based on their environment. Our decision matrix is not static. As we experience new stimuli we create new rules and responses. Some responses are hard wired (fight, flight freeze or sexual reproduction), but many are learned from parents (religious indoctrination) and many are learned from social interaction (music and fashion). As a parent, unless you home school, you have much less influence on your children than you might think. \n\nAt a certain point, around six years old I believe, children begin the process of breaking away from parental control as primary and test self-control as primary. This process continues through puberty into adulthood. If self-control is not established by early puberty there is a serious problem, and if not established by the late teens the parents have failed at producing a productive member of society. \n\nMy main question to you is this:\n\nAre you what your parents wanted? Are you sure? \n\nI bet you aren\'t exactly what they wanted. How does that make you feel? If you don\'t feel good about yourself then why would you want your children to feel like you?','491hn6',1,0,2,2,NULL,0,0),(1,1457199281,'d0ooeod','gazork_chumble_spuzz','r/changemyview',0,'First, a few questions. Do you agree with all of your parents\' values? Do you believe everything they believe, think how they think? Are you essentially a clone of your parents who is incapable of thinking for yourself? \n\nThe fact of the matter is, nobody can guarantee that their kids will grow up to never stray from their values. This is the motivation behind cultish religious groups, like super-conservative Christian groups who believe that it\'s their God-given mandate to have a multitude of children who will all believe what they believe and slowly take over society for Jesus. They have kids so they can produce a clone army. It\'s not a solid plan. It doesn\'t work. Sure, sometimes the child will grow up and will believe in the things they were taught growing up. But more often than not, what happens is that no matter how we are raised, we grow up, move out, begin to experience life, and start making our own choices. Some of those choices inevitably run counter to what our parents would have wanted us to do. That\'s normal. It doesn\'t mean that nobody should have kids, or that you\'ve failed as a parent. If I did everything my parents thought I should do, or lived only according to their values, I would not be the person I am today. I\'d be a more restricted version of myself, yearning for more. My parents did not fail in raising me because I grew up to eventually disagree with them about certain things; they were wonderful parents, and they did a great job (if I say so myself, ha!). \n\nIf you have kids, you need to accept the fact that they are their own people, and you cannot force them to think or believe like you, especially once they become adults. If you can\'t accept that your kids are who they are, and you can influence them but not override them, then having kids is a mistake. \n\nI also don\'t entirely agree with your definition of great parenting. Yes, it\'s great to spend a lot of time with your children and to put care and effort into showing them how to be moral people. They need guidance. However, what you describe veers a bit into a very heavy-handed and forceful way of telling kids *what* to think, and punishing them for disagreeing. That\'s dangerous. Kids need to be taught HOW to think instead. There needs to be room for them to have their own opinions and thoughts as they reach adulthood. There needs to be an acceptance for their individuality, and they need space to think things through and find their own conscience. It\'s very hard sometimes.

People hate it when race or sex is used as an example so I\'ll use the more popular example of class: If you live in a typical capitalist society, rich people have a lot of power over poor people. And most rich people were born rich. A lot of times, the money snowballed after generations of rich people marrying other rich people, capitalizing and investing on the money they already had. Meanwhile, most poor people were born poor. Poor people often don\'t have access to resources like quality education, money for college, and subsequently jobs that require that very education they lack. You could also look at the housing situation--lots of poor people are confined to renting because they don\'t have the capital to buy a house. Also many of them cannot move or find better jobs easily if they can\'t afford a car. A rich person could more easily make money by buying properties and then renting or selling them when the price goes up. They more easily find new job opportunities because they can afford to travel at their convenience.\n\nNot all rich people are bad as individuals... But many rich people are ignorant or apathetic to the hardships that poor people face. There are certainly rich people who operate charities and support policies and institutions to help the poor, but there are many who prefer policies and systems that benefit themselves at the expense of poor people (lowering taxes, privatizing health care and education, etc). And as long as this continues, one could certainly look at this society and categorize the rich as the oppressor and the poor as the oppressed. Even if a rich person empathized with poor people, it doesn\'t change the fact that they belong to the oppressive demographic. And, one could certainly argue that a rich person who was inactive and did not participate in feeding into the system is still upholding the status quo and benefiting from it regardless. The inactive rich person does not dismantle institutionalized classism, s/he just lets it continue like someone watching a building burn without bothering to fetch some water or clear the exit.\n\nI won\'t bore you with the history of race/sex/sexuality and all of that stuff.

Women are making these choices because they know that if a child needs to stay home sick from school or be picked up early, they - and not their husbands or partners - will most likely be expected to handle it. \n\nThe \"second shift\" is a very well-known phenomenon where women work less overtime and have less flexibility in the workplace because they need to get home to do even *more* work - unpaid, under-appreciated work like cleaning the house and cooking meals. Somebody needs to do these things, and the burden falls predominately on women, even when they work as much or more than their male partners.\n\n>all the evidence points to the wage gap being personal choice\n\nPersonal choices aren\'t made in a vacuum. Most of the academic discussion around the wage gap revolves around affecting the factors that make women choose these lower-paying, lower-status jobs.\n\n>the amount of CEO\'s being whatever gender really doesn\'t affect the rest of the populace\n\nThis is like, a whole \'nother kettle of fish but...just for funsies: Yes it does. What you see around you affects you perception of what is available to you. If there are no female (or black or Latino or gay) CEOs, many women (or people of color or LGBT people) assume that the position of CEO is simply not something they can or should strive for. Additionally, when you attain a high-ranking position where you affect the lives of others, you bring with you the collective experience of your own life. So when you are a member of an under-represented group, you are more likely to use your enormous power and influence understand and work to solve the struggles of that group. Which, understandably, can be very important to and very much affect the lives of members of that group.','4js7xx',0,0,0,0,NULL,0,0),(10,1463509591,'d39481a','[deleted]','r/changemyview',1,'>This wage gap is more the differences in the overall wages between both sexes and the fact that is largely perpetrated by the fields which men and women go into. \n\nThe disparity in fields they go into is an issue in and of itself that is part of the larger wage gap issue. \n\n>I get how it may feel like an issue because surely any discrepancy must mean discrimination, but it\'s quite clear that most of this wage gap is caused by choice in professions\n\nThe choice of profession is only the last in a long chain of events that steer young boys and girls toward their particular adult path.

Even if I never explicitly tell him that he\'s unintelligent, he\'ll get the picture. In this instance, did I do something wrong? Even if I genuinely believe that I\'m doing him a favor (perhaps because I\'m also anti-intellectual and think being smart is a bad thing), and it\'s difficult to attribute moral blame to me, is this situation good? \n\nIt seems like something has gone wrong here. What if he had the potential to be a genius, if he were nurtured the right way? Society is deprived of something important.

He might very well be satisfied with his current job because he doesn\'t know better.

You can see http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/ndtv-mid-term-poll-does-india-still-want-arranged-marriages-498043 as an example - >85% of marriages are still arranged as of today.  Indians in general may date, flirt, have flings but when it comes to marriage, they still overwhelmingly prefer an arranged marriage.  Now there is certainly a segment of the population that feels obligated or pressured into doing it.  There are some might choose differently if they were encouraged to date or were told that falling in love before you marry someone is an acceptable thing to do.  But by large, most people when polled tell you that they choose to get arranged married.  A majority even believe that it\'s superior to a western concept of dating to find a partner (and they\'ll trot out India\'s low divorce rates and long partnerships to justify this).\n\nNow, I\'m going to assume for a second that you aren\'t from India and don\'t happen to think that arranged marriages are in fact superior.  If you were to analyze the Indian marriage system, would you consider it \"free\".  Are Indian really \"choosing\" to get arranged married or is it just a status-quo bias?  Might it make sense to \"fix\" the bias to let people actually choose how they get married (or if they even want to get married) without any major repercussions or social blowback?  How might you convince an Indian that there might be a structural/institutional effect at play here?\n\nNow view career choice with a similar lens.  Are we really free to choose our careers?  Do men and women get access to the same educational opportunities?  Do they make the same kind of network contacts?  Do they get the same kinds of toys?  Do they see the professions they like depicted the same way in popular media?  The \"fix\" might not have anything to do with pay at all.  It might involve shifting cultural norms and such changes always appear to be non-issues at first - that\'s what it means for something to be normal to a culture.

You said you want to know if daycares can beat moms. That\'s a tough question because there is such a huge range of both mothers and day cares. However, from experience as a preschool teacher and having studied this topic for my Master\'s, I can confidently say that a child\'s development is largely influenced by their parents and their parenting styles/education level/SES <b>regardless</b> of their preschool/daycare situation. That is to say, even if a child goes to a super shitty preschool, if their parents are reading and speaking to them at home, the preschool situation makes little to no difference. It just happens to be that parents who pay for and research higher-end preschools tend to be the same ones that read and speak to them a lot at home too.\n\n2. You criticized certain daycares/preschools for being places that children only play with other children. Free play is actually a crucial part of development that many preschools tend to forget now a days. Especially before age 5, it is much more beneficial for children to free play with other children and adults rather than to be sitting down for structured lessons. Sensory development is a huge thing that is often forgotten in curriculum, and is supported through free outdoor play or play with various kinds of toys and environments. As such, the daily chance to play with lots of other children is actually a huge benefit of preschool over stay-at-home moms. \n\n3.

For them, sacrificing a career is more than worth it.

Not a in-home nanny.  Many day cares are very education-based.  They learn songs, letters, colors, etc.  Sure, a parent can teach that but socialization is probably the most important part.  Your kid being with other kids for eight or nine hours a day changes them.  Whenever my daughter moves up to the \"next room\" she is noticeably more advanced within a week.  Kids learn from each other as much as they do the teachers.  My kid is way more advanced than kids of similar age who stay at home.  \n\nLastly, financials.  Unless you are an extremely low earner and/or have multiple kids in daycare, it always makes sense financially for both parents to work.  The opportunity cost of staying home is huge!   Retirement funds, college funds, etc. My wife makes about $50,000 per year, and we pay about $8,000 a year in daycare so if she stayed home we would be out $40,000 per year.

While there was a marginally increased incidence of behavior problems among children who spent 3-4 years at daycare before age 5, this difference is most likely caused by low-quality infant and toddler daycare centers.  Since care for infants and toddlers is generally more expensive than daycare for preschoolers, many parents are forced to opt for cheaper, lower quality centers with a higher child-to-adult ratio.  The strongest predictor of behavioral, social and educational outcomes was *parenting quality*, not daycare. \n\nThe most effective ways to improve early childhood education are 1.) increase funding to make high-quality daycares more available, 2.) increase parenting quality through education, and 3.) provide paid maternal, paternal and even grandparental leave so kids can spend more time at home *without* permanently wrecking the mother\'s career or leaving her stressed, bored and unsupported.

The idea that funding gifted students over specials needs to the extent of routing all special needs funding into gifted students furthers the discourse of \"otherhood\" and provides a political climate in which marginalizing groups who are \"less valuable\" becomes expedient.

If the language seems a little brusque, its just the nature the field! \n\nEducation is a cost/benefit choice for both the state and the individual. It is unique because most of the costs tend to be current, and benefits in the long run. Having set up the background, here are the arguments for the individual and the state levels:\n\n\nIndividual:\n\nBecause the individual benefits are not immediate, access to credit is vital. A gifted individual will have relatively easy access to credit. They may get scholarships, sponsorships or grants. A struggling individual will not have easy access to credit, and thus the state must provide any additional support. Who is more likely to be funded? The aspiring computer scientist or the aspiring McDonald\'s worker? \n\nEven if the gifted individual does not have access to credit of excellent terms, they are in a far better position to invest in their future. Their earning potential is much higher, and thus they are able to borrow conventionally for private extra help. Conventional borrowing for the struggling individual would be an extremely high risk financial strategy, and almost certainly unsustainable. Thus the state has to step in. \n\n\nState:\n\nThe positive externalities for education (or the benefits to wider society) diminish as the level of education rises. This is why primary schools are almost globally now free, whilst universities tend to cost quite a bit. The higher in education you go, the more the benefits manifest in the earning of the individual. If we put the gifted and the struggling individuals on a scale from upper to lower education, the struggling individual will obviously be lower. It makes more sense for the state to invest in that lower level of education, because the individual earnings will barely change but the positive externalities will be huge. Its the difference between an alien to society, or an integrated, hopefully literate to some degree, individual who understands how to function in that society. Every gain made at that lower level represents a massive change to how integrated and independent that struggling individual can be. Meanwhile at the higher level, every gain represents an increase in individual earnings. Whats the real benefit to society if an individual makes a lot of money by founding a successful company?

It is an unfortunate reality but hitting that base-level education for a special needs student will simply be higher than hitting it for able-bodied students.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with spending extra resources on gifted students, but underfunding special needs programs poses a severe risk of violating the rights of special needs students.','58qeax',1,0,1,1,NULL,0,0),(1,1477191523,'d93tesi','Ectophylla_alba','r/changemyview',0,'>First, this assumes that there is a fixed amount of \"education money\" and money that is spent on gifted education will be unavailable to spend on special education and vice versa.\n\nThis is a very very incorrect assumption.  In point of fact most of these programs draw from the same pool and function in the same kind of way. \n\n>Fourthly, this is viewing special education solely in terms of mental/behavioral terms, this doesn\'t include stuff like speech classes for an otherwise mentally sound student nor accommodations for a student in a wheelchair.\n\nThis is also taking a pretty broad stroke on \"special education\" for the disabled.  That category ranges all the way from learning disabilities [like dysgraphia which I have] and serious intellectual disabilities.  All of the funding is taken from the same pool and is handled by the same system. \n\nThe third and largest wrong assumption you make all through this post is that special education for gifted students is actually better for them than a standard education.  Do you have any evidence to support this?  \n\nBased on my own personal experience as a child who was both gifted *and* disabled, the benefits from these respective special educations are miles apart.  The main benefit for gifted children in public schools is that they are removed from the general population so, arguably, they can work at a faster pace without being slowed down by other students.  But this has the extremely negative social effect of making them arrogant jerks who don\'t work well in groups, a blatant detriment to society.  Other than that, there\'s really nothing terribly special going on with gifted classes.  They certainly don\'t get better teachers than average, or better books, or better equipment.  They don\'t get different pedagogical methods or more room for self-directed learning.  All they get is to be set apart.\n\nOn the other hand, special education for disabled students--all disabled students--is unique and targeted.  Disabled students receive specialized plans put together by teachers, parents and psychologists to outline ways to help the student overcome their disabilities while encouraging their strengths.  Disabled students receive separate classes (like gifted ones) that are extremely small--usually 4-5 people--and staffed by a large number of teachers.  Very disabled students might even get one-on-one aid through most of the day.\n\nNow that might sound like a lot of expense just to help a person go from \"useless\" to \"average\" but if that money was going towards gifted children, what exactly would it be used for?  Does a gifted student need a one-on-one tutor?  Do they need special plans for their learning?  More homework?  No.  If anything they need less constraining schooling which will rob them of any interest in learning.  And moreover they need to learn how to deal with people who are, ya know, average joes.  \n\nOf course all of this is just based on my experience in both groups.  If you\'ve got some numbers somewhere that show that these kinds of programs really have results for gifted kids, taking them from an average person to a wildly successful person, by all means, show it to me.\n\nBut I still probably won\'t be all that convinced, because this very concept really demonstrates a dark and uncomfortable view of society.  Why is taking a person from a life on welfare, unable to provide for themselves at all, possibly without any opportunity to get out of the house or interact with other people, to a life where they can pay some of their own bills and interact with society at large, \"tiny?\"  Isn\'t that kind of thing exactly what society is for?

Let\'s say that Bill Gates grew up, not to become a computing pioneer, but instead grew up to be a successful used car salesman. The personal computing market is worth billions and the cost of society had Bill Gates (and other computing pioneers) not had access to computers would be billions.\n\nIf Bill Gates didn\'t have the resources to build a very large software business, someone else with the same knowledge and resources as Gates would have. Becoming a billionaire is exceptional, but there is nothing really proprietary in knowledge about it that keeps other with better opportunities from doing so. The computing industry was already well on its way of growing quickly even before Gates stepped in.\n\nIt\'s also a false assumption that the niche Gates filled would be irreplaceable. Your perceived cost to society is based on speculation, and appropriately, this kind of \"what if\" scenario in fiction also falls into the genre of speculative history.\n\nIf Bill Gates became a car salesman, a multitude of other big events can still happen in the computer industry. Some other company would have developed a single OS that ran on commodity Intel/IBM hardware. There was nothing very unique beyond DOS as the idea of a GUI was taken from Xerox. I imagine IBM would have done it alone and developed their own kind of DOS and OS/2 software by themselves, albeit looking somewhat differently. \n\nThen most of the world would have their OS running on compatible hardware produced by a multiple of hardware vendors. Whoever had devoted the largest effort to developing application compatibility between OS releases would have had the lead, since that is the real driving factor. No matter if Bill Gates wasn\'t in the picture- there are still other software competitors around. If Windows had never been invented, we\'d still have similar operating systems on similar concepts from Xerox. So, in all probability Apple would have a good chance moving in with an early runaway success in the mass market. All because Gates decided to become a car salesman.\n\nSee how wild speculative history can turn out to be when you are trying to predict the perceived costs to society in a history that we are not living part of?

Trans people are, undeniably, biologically what they were assigned at birth (to shorten this, call it \"biological sex\").\n2. It is reasonable to judge trans people by how you perceive their biological sex.\n3. Pronouns are specifically related to presentation.\n4. There are only three modes of presentation, so there should only be three sets of pronouns - he, she, and they.\n5. And lastly, neopronouns are a common issue people deal with.\n\n> Trans people are, undeniably, biologically what they were assigned at birth (to shorten this, call it \"biological sex\").\n\nThe idea of biological sex as a binary (male vs female) and the idea of biological sex as a category that has any reasonable use outside of medical or sexual contexts are both flawed. First off, biological sex isn\'t a binary. There is a spread of variations as to what constitutes male-typical or female-typical traits, and there are many intersex conditions that fit somewhere in the middle of that spread. Biological sex isn\'t some black-white \"truth\" that is more descriptive than gender - especially when it comes to trans people, who often have a mix of what are generally considered male and female traits - for example, I have male-typical levels of hormones, a mix of male and female secondary sex characteristics, and female-typical genitals and gonads. This will change over the course of my life, and that state of these systems at earlier points in my life doesn\'t affect who I am now. Now given this, the idea that anyone outside of a medical or sexual context feels a need to know and describe people by biological sex makes little sense, as it\'s not relevant, not descriptive enough, and unrelated to who that person actually is.\n\n> It is reasonable to judge trans people by how you perceive their biological sex.\n\nAs I\'ve already shown, biological sex is flawed even when you are fully informed on the details of someone\'s medical state. Trying to judge people\'s biological sex is even more flawed - what if there are conflicting signals? Do you judge \"obviously trans\" or \"obviously androgynous\" people more harshly? How do you respond to calling a cis person the wrong pronoun because you see them as the wrong gender? Even among trans people, we can\'t always tell if someone is transitioning from female or from male - how do you think you can automatically and correctly know someone\'s gender? Trying to understand someone\'s \"real gender\" or \"biological sex\" is a) irrelevant and b) **hard**.\n\n> Pronouns are specifically related to presentation.\n\nSo assuming we\'ve decided that biological sex is sorta meaningless in a social context, and there\'s no point trying to guess it, we move on to looking specifically at presentation. From what I\'ve read, you seem to be of the opinion that pronouns relate specifically and only to presentation, and to some degree they do, in that pronouns relate to gender and gender often relates to presentation. When you\'re interacting with strangers, you do have to make guesses about gender and therefore pronouns, but in any context where you are working with someone whom you know, their gender is known to you - either directly through presentation or indirectly through them letting you know. In this case, you know what gender they are and you know because of that, again either directly or indirectly, which pronouns they prefer.\n\nThis point is actually easy to refute - if you have a friend who is trans and does not currently pass as their gender, would you refer to them as the pronoun they use or the pronoun of the gender they were assigned at birth? If you know someone\'s gender and pronouns, there\'s no need to judge based on presentation.\n\n> There are only three modes of presentation, so there should only be three sets of pronouns - he, she, and they.\n\nOne of your issues with pronouns <=> presentation seems to be that we know what \"he\" and \"she\" looks like, but not anything else. I\'m actually unclear if you support \"they\" as a pronoun or not, but regardless there\'s already a very clear point that pronouns and presentation don\'t actually correlate. Furthermore, even if they did, there\'s far more modes of presentation than 3 single states - it\'s pretty much a spectrum, and there\'s no designation as to what corresponds to what gender or pronoun. \"They\" has some definition as a gender neutral or gender unknown pronoun, but we can pretty easily assume that most neopronoun choices relate to presentations that are not strictly read as male or female.\n\n> And lastly, neopronouns are a common issue people deal with.\n\nI\'m trans. I\'m one of the officers of the several-years-running, currently being officially founded trans groups at my college. I know somewhere between 30 and 50 trans people in real life, and quite a few more through interactions online. I have never met a trans person in real life who uses neopronouns, and the only person I have ever talked to online who uses a pronoun other than he/she/they used \"it,\" which it acknowledged was a very controversial and very unsettling choice. Neopronouns are not a common choice among trans people, and those who make that choice do so with the knowledge that people *will not like them.* People who choose neopronouns do so because the other common choices likely make them incredibly uncomfortable, and often offer an alternative set of pronouns, such as \"they,\" that is more accessible for those who have trouble remembering or learning their pronouns. Neopronouns aren\'t some rampant issue with every trans person choosing their own personal set to perfectly match their gender, no matter what the 13-year-olds on tumblr seem to have led you to believe. They are a rare occurrence that you will almost certainly only deal with a few times in your life, at the most.','5b3x0t',1,0,2,2,NULL,0,0),(1,1478435634,'d9o27h8','Death2Evil','r/changemyview',0,'This argument is tired and dry and sad...\n\nBecause preferred pronouns are not generally a matter of \"rights\".

Repeated, intentional misgendering by a lecturer probably already counts as harassment.**\n\nTo use your \'asshole\' analogy, if a lecturer were to refer to one of their students as an asshole, and intentionally continued to do so after being asked not to by the student, that would count as harassment.* Similarly, if the lecturer were corrected, and they continued to pick on the student in class using the wrong gender on purpose for several weeks, then that should be taken as seriously - whether the student was male or female, trans, non-binary or not - as it shows the lecturer has a lack of respect for their student and creates an unnecessarily unpleasant work environment.\n\nAny action can become harassment (or bullying) if it is repetitive, unwanted and unnecessary: particularly if the perpetrator knows that their actions are causing distress. If someone tells their lecturer that their actions are causing distress, but they carrying on doing those actions for no good reason, then - in law - that becomes harassment.\n\n**2. Getting someone\'s gender wrong by accident isn\'t a criminal offence.**\n\nAccording to [this BBC article](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-37875695):\n\n> Bill C-16, currently before Canada\'s parliament, prohibits discrimination under the Canadian Human Rights Act on the basis of gender identity and expression. The bill covers the federal government and federally regulated industries like banks or airlines. It also extends hate speech provisions under Canada\'s criminal code to transgendered people. \"I don\'t think any legal expert would say using an inappropriate pronoun, while not something that respects the human rights of trans people, would ever result in a criminal conviction,\" said Kyle Kirkup, a law professor with the University of Ottawa who specialises in gender identity and sexuality law. But Dr Peterson could face sanction under Ontario\'s human rights code, which extended protection to trans people in 2012.\nPenalties range from fines and damages to mandatory anti-discrimination training.\n\nHowever, the [Ontario Human Rights Code](http://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/ontario-human-rights-code) is about equal rights and opportunities in the specific areas of housing, access to goods and services and harassment by employers or service providers. As far as I can see, a lecturer would *only* receive a fine or antidiscrimination training *if* their actions were shown to be harassment, according to other existing law. The law doesn\'t require anyone to use \'ze\', \'zir\', or any other unusual pronouns.\n\n**3. I don\'t believe that this is as simple as just a free speech issue.**\n\nLecturers have a responsibility to teach their subject and create a good environment for learning. If freedom of speech were the first and last word on the issue, a lecturer could give a year\'s worth of lectures in Swahili or Doors lyrics if they wanted. That would be OK by free speech law, but they\'d probably be fired for not doing their job properly.\n\nIf a lecturer were to incorrectly call all of their black students either Tyrone or Latisha (or some other stereotypical name, for example), it might be forgiven as a genuine mistake once or twice - but if it continued after being corrected several times, it would be seen as racist. I don\'t think we\'d be looking at this kind of incident through the free speech lens. It would be unnecessarily alienating a group of students, creating an unnecessarily antagonistic environment and in my view it would be entirely reasonable for the university ask the lecturer what the hell they were doing.\n\n**4. Speaking in a gender neutral way isn\'t difficult and doesn\'t even require \'special snowflake\' pronouns.**\n\nEnglish is very versatile and a more gender-neutral language than most Latin-based and Germanic languages, which have gender baked into basic grammar. I can talk to *you* directly, using second person, without referring to *your* gender in any way. I can also refer to an ambiguous third person without referencing *their* gender, by using the \'singular *they*\' pronoun (which I\'m a fan of). If one\'s feeling posh, one can talk entirely using the \'indefinite pronoun\' - although one might sound a bit like the Queen!\n\nAlso, there are a fair few people who aren\'t trans or nonbinary, but occasionally get mistaken for the opposite gender. Maybe there\'s a tall \'butch lesbian\' girl with short hair, or a long haired goth guy who wears eyeliner. If she was called mistakenly called \'him\' or he was called \'her\' when picked on to answer a question in a lecture, they might find it embarrassing, and they\'d be right to have a quiet word with the lecturer afterwards to put them right. To me, it seems reasonable to expect the same treatment for trans or nonbinary people: there aren\'t that many people who fall outside the gender norm, so it doesn\'t seem unreasonable to me for lecturers to make an effort for the couple of people who do. But for lecturers who find that too much effort, it\'s very possible to talk to (and about) people without referencing or presuming their gender at all - as I\'ve done for the entirety of the previous 3 points.','5b3x0t',0,0,0,0,NULL,0,0),(1,1479923158,'daco7t4','AutoModerator','r/changemyview',0,'**Note:** Your thread has **not** been removed.\nYour post\'s topic seems to be fairly common on this subreddit.

Do you want the average person not to read above a seventh grade level?

Tons of research has been done in education, and a lot of the skills that we \"used to\" learn are still there, theyve just been cleverly hidden within literature or writing units.  We still do literary analysis, analyzing arguments, writing persuasive, informative, argumentative papers.  An outside example, i teach esl, we have to teach grammar, vocabulary, production, comprehension, pronunciation, etc.  this used to be done independently.  People who wanted to learn language were taught by sitting them in a lab with a tape deck and headphones, listening and repeating, hours a day, for years, before they were able to speak a language.  We dont do that anymore. to give you a basic idea, one unit would be daily activities, where students learn daily routine vocab (brush my teeth, watch tv, etc), chores (make the bed, take out the trash), simple present tense, adverbs of frequency, parts of the day and time.  students describe their routines, they ask and answer questions, maybe they describe a celebrity or characters daily routine, whatever.

People are much more likely to change careers several times during their professional lives now than they were a generation ago.  For this reason, its more important than ever that individuals have abroad range of skills and knowledge bases that they can use to adapt to an ever changing marketplace.

Why? Because they can be looked up online.\n\n\"Can be looked up online\" does not equate to \"learned\".  Actual knowledge isn\'t the memorization of facts but the understanding of how these facts fit in with the overall picture.  For example, when was the (American) Civil War?  We should all know without looking it up that it was in the 1860\'s.  The specific battles may not be important, but the general time frame is vitally important to understanding American history.  When I was in high school, my American history teacher was born probably in the 1940\'s or 1950\'s.  I don\'t know how old she was.  She was black.  Her great-grandparents were slaves.  If you don\'t know when the Civil War happened, and if you don\'t know what it was about, you can\'t really get this context.  She told us some of the stories that she\'d heard from her grandmother about *her* parents.  The Civil War is just one of the many pieces of general knowledge that we need to be able to synthesize together to make sense of the world around us.  Why do I mention the Civil War?  Because, when I was in college, a friend of mine (at a different school) was writing some paper.  She IMed me to ask -- I\'m not kidding -- \"about how long ago was the Civil War?\"  This was... 2002-2003, I think, so I think it may have been before Wikipedia but it was definitely easy to look this up.  The paper was about something else; this was I guess some side detail.  I don\'t know.  But... how can someone not know this?\n\nWhen it comes to things like physics (you have several physics-related examples there), yeah, if you don\'t know how gravity works you can look it up.  You\'ll get this weird sequence of symbols: F = Gm1m2/r^(2).  Dafuq?  How do you even begin to make sense of this mess?  Well, if you\'ve learned basic math, you can at least understand that the letters represent variables, they\'re multiplied together or divided or raised to powers or whatever, and those two lines mean that the stuff on the left is equal to the stuff on the right.  If you *haven\'t* learned basic math, you\'re fucked, because it will take you months at least to get to the point where you can even understand that equation, much less *think* about it.  So OK, you\'ve figured out how to plug numbers in and get some number out of this equation.  But unless you\'ve *really* learned math, you don\'t know that the force depends on the inverse square of the distance, so gravity gets weaker as the objects get farther apart, but stable orbits are still possible.  Now, suppose you wanted to understand black holes.  Well, fuck you, you can\'t, because you don\'t even understand basic gravitation.  So you have to look that up, and spend months trying to understand basic physics and doing kinematics problems, only to realize that this equation actually *doesn\'t work* near a black hole which is the whole point of black holes, and instead you have this tensor shit that makes even less sense and Killing vectors (that\'s a thing) and metric tensors and geodesics and fucking Christoffel symbols (fucking Christoffel symbols) and at this point you just give up.  BUT if you have at least a passing knowledge of astrophysics, you understand enough to skip all that and get straight to the point: the gravity of a black hole is so big that it sucks in even light, and nothing can travel faster than light.  And this is totally fine if you don\'t understand how gravity works.  If you *do* understand how gravity works, that only raises further questions, because light is massless and the gravitational force is proportional to mass.  At this point you become a physics major and study general relativity, but the small bit of data that you might get from looking something up online is *nonsensical* if you don\'t have the requisite knowledge already.  And you can\'t just look up that requisite knowledge because you don\'t know what you\'re actually missing.  A basic high school knowledge of physics is enough for you to at least have a light when trying to understand physics concepts, and while most of it will be far beyond you, you can at least see where you\'re going a little bit.  You know a little bit here and there, and you have a relatively good view of what you don\'t know but can easily learn.\n\nThere\'s the eternal question of \"when will I ever need to know this?\"  You\'ll probably never *need* to know it, but learning -- actually *knowing* those facts you think are pointless -- is how we participate in society, how we understand references in media, how we make sense of the news, how we tell fact from Trump tweet.  Learning is how we can decide whether numbers are realistic or what the effects of a policy might be.  If you know a little bit of high school chemistry, for example, you won\'t be afraid of eating unpronounceable things like \"ascorbic acid\" (vitamin C).  If you know a little bit of biology, you won\'t get snookered by the anti-vaxxers, and I hope to whatever deity or deities or lack thereof that you won\'t believe in lizard people.  A little bit of literature, and maybe you can write something that doesn\'t totally suck in your Reddit comments (whoops).\n\nAll these things require actually knowing some facts, not just being able to look them up.  The point of knowing the facts is so that you can synthesize understanding from them, so that when new information comes in, you can compare it internally against those facts, and when you need to solve a problem, you can recall those facts.  You rarely need them *directly*, but you do need them.','5liyd3',1,0,1,1,NULL,0,0),(2,1483346763,'dbwck0o','Mc-Dreamy','r/changemyview',0,'rhetoric isn\'t something you teach in a class.

I wouldn\'t generalize feminist spaces, because each one is radically different, and aims and ideology vary. I\'ve worked on a similar project, targeted at colleges. We\'d go there, and have a talk, have interactive exercises etc, aimed at educating students about rape, and sex. One of the things we did was a true or false exercise, where we would hand out a list and ask people to decide whether the statements were true or false. \"Can men be raped?\" was always one of them. Girls answered yes more often than boys. When it came to questions about consent, again the girls were better informed. There is a knowledge gap here, and it is being addressed.\n\nAt first, my friends and I found it rather simplistic and preachy, but after being told to come up with our own exercises, we realized how exhaustive the original ones were. They accounted for a number of possibilities, including men being raped by other men(homosexuality is illegal here).\n\nI don\'t think you will find a campaign that says that men cannot be raped. They put a sizeable amount of thought into being inclusive, and while individual programs may be focused only on one aspect, you should also understand that feminism comes in many different forms, and their focus is different. The example you linked to is sponsored by Battered Women\'s Support Services, so I don\'t find it surprising that they do not explicitly include male victims.

An in-car nav system is likely to always have a local copy of the latest map, it would only need to connect to the net to find out if the map has changed.\n\nThe only issue is that the self-driving car is now unaware of traffic conditions.

In order for electric cars to truly dethrone the internal combustion engine (ICE):\n•	The typical electric car will need to have a 300-400 mile range that competes with ICE based cars. \n•	The supercharging capability needs to give you a 15 -20 min near empty to near full charge capability to go another ~250 miles\n•	Supercharging needs to be incorporated much like a normal gas station in the ubiquity, and in order for them to really survive they will need to have on site electricity storage, the site based battery storage technology is really taking off and I anticipate batteries to be able to level out peak load outs and to be used with electric cars.\n\nNow lets talk about self driving cars for a little bit. These cars don’t necessarily need the internet. I’m an engineer by trade (not in this industry), but if I was designing a self driving car system and network I would utilize the internet but not depend on it. For a massive self driving net work to be put into place I envision requirements of the system to ensure that no single failure can lead to a catastrophic event (much like aerospace, which is my industry). You can easily do this with NFC technology and sensor fusion networks where the network is really individual networks between vehicles, coupled with robust sensor systems and internal memory that stores learned historical traffic patterns and other items. I would never design an entire something that is reliant on the internet alone because that wouldn’t be very safe and likely wouldn’t get to market. \n\nSo with that background lets go through some of your points.\n\nElectric cars require electricity which may not be readily available. \n\nLike I said above I highly doubt we would ever have an incorporation rate if a simple grid failure would strand the whole population. I believe that battery stations will become as ubiquitous as electric cars and will ultimately be tied together to prove feasibility.\n\nAlso gas powered cars need gas which is actually a limited resource in that if you aren’t making it at refineries you are kind of screwed, but in a situation where you can cobble together a solar charger you can refill an electric car. \n\nElectric vehicles are vulnerable as off-road vehicles\n\nThis one doesn’t make much sense. You could easily design an electric car to have much higher clearance, re-enforce the battery area etc. But in a situation that’s an emergency, a focus or a yaris or any other gas powered small car isn’t going to be doing much off-roading and the places those cars could go current electric cars could go, and I would argue the AWD telsa can go many more places than many FWD compact cars. \n\nYou can\'t just store more power in a convenient can\n\nTrue, but as solar panel technology continues to rapidly improve you could easily take a portable solar charger with you, where ever you go.\n\nSelf-driving cars are dependent on the internet\nThis isn’t really true. My 2016 outback has a ton of self driving features that don’t require the internet, it’s all based on internal sensors. Most GPS units download offline maps and function just fine without the internet. \nAlso something to consider. Self driving cars in a hurricane situation would be significantly better than regular people driving for a host of reasons:\n•	They can optimize the route out of the effected area if enough are in use\n•	They can travel at higher speeds with minimal distance between vehicles \n•	High self driving incorporation will reduce congestion and stupid human drivers making accidents which clog up main arteries and slow down evacuations less likely.\nAlso to end.\nIf people can’t read a map they are screwed no matter what car they are in \n','6tqs3b',2,0,13,6,NULL,0,0),(2,1502759719,'dlmszbs','ACrusaderA','r/changemyview',0,'1 - Many electric cars come with or can be charged via a generator.

What they love, hate, hope, fear, and everything they do to act upon their feelings and goals. Thus, being so character-centric, Shakespeare\'s plays can be adapted to nearly any setting. \n\nI\'ll also answer your points, as best I can:\n\n* **Any novelty it once had has long worn off.** You\'re right that it is often a way to showcase Shakespeare\'s timeless quality, but this is far from its sole purpose. For films in particular, you want to avoid using the same setting for a new adaptation of the play; this is why you\'ll have *Hamlet* set in 19th Century Denmark rather than in the Middle Ages, or *Romeo and Juliet* set in 1990\'s America. A change in setting, while unable to alter the play, is able to provide a different tone. There\'s a difference between a swordfight and a shoot-out, and communication changes if you\'ve upgraded from letters to telephones.\n\n* **It\'s patronizing to the audience.** Shakespeare\'s method of writing allows the audience to always be able to understand the context of a spoken line. This is because of the meter, whether iambic or otherwise; the precise method the lines are written in informs the actor how to speak it, to make sure emphasis is placed on the correct words. Iambic pentameter is most common in his works, but by no means the sole meter (as my acting teacher said, \"Shakespeare always writes in iambic pentameter, except when he doesn\'t.\"). Because of this, the setting does not change the meaning of lines; at most, it offers a different backdrop to what is being said. \n\n* **It gets downright silly at times.** Campy is fine, depending on the viewer, and does nothing to take away from the language. 1996\'s *Romeo + Juliet* has often been regarded by Shakespearean scholars as one of the most accurate adaptations of the play. And it is a *silly* movie, especially after 20 years. This is more a personal preference than anything; people take campiness better or worse.\n\n* **It doesn\'t always even achieve the goal of making the play relatable.** As I\'ve stated above, Shakespeare\'s works are not dependent on the setting, but on the characters. You yourself have spoken to his ability to comment on the human condition, and this is where that holds most true. Everyone can relate to Hamlet\'s plight, Macbeth\'s ambition, Romeo and Juliet\'s passion, and Othello\'s anger. Whether they wear togas or blazers makes little difference: they remain humans, and that is an immutable quality.\n\n* **Trying to make it familiar to the audience can make it less exotic and magical.** I believe this is another matter of personal preference. For me, I love almost any adaptation of Shakespeare. The magic, to me, is how the characters act in a different setting, with the same motivations and actions.\n\nAlso, for credibility: I\'ve acted in two Shakespearean plays (*Hamlet* as The Ghost, *Two Gentlemen of Verona* as ensemble), and have taken a university-level course in Acting for Shakespeare.

However, this production was set in the 1930s south, a setting plagued by Jim Crow, and had a specific focus on racial oppression (as well as homophobia and domestic abuse) rather than just simply \"The ruling class screwing over the citizens is a problem.\"\n\nOne of the actors in the cast said that his grandfather, who is very racist and very homophobic, still came to the show to see him perform, and after that performance, the actor reported that the show really made his grandfather rethink his prejudices. That wouldn\'t have happened if we had set it in Rome like Shakespeare had intended.','6ukkj4',0,0,0,0,NULL,0,0),(1,1508153804,'dofsngz','Genoscythe_','r/changemyview',0,'I think the idea behind your theory was, that the technology that would be required to help us overcome the upcoming challenges, would inevitably elevate us too once we start to use it, given the power it presumably has. \n\nBut your list of the challenges are terrible examples of that. \n\n> Rising nationalism in the west. Also in China, India and Japan.\n\nNationalism is not a self-reinforcing pit of destruction, it\'s just a societal mood that can swing back and forth. It\'s not like the environmental crisis or the antibiotics crisis, where we see the problem, and we see how it will get worse  and worse by it\'s nature, unless we do someting. Maybe the next generation will be less nationalistic. Or maybe it will be exacty as nationalistic as the current one. \n\n> -Renewables have a lower EROEI than fossil fuels, and their transition will not be easy.\n\n>-Climate change.\n\n>-The environmental degradation.\n\nThese are all classic examples of a crisis that we mostly just need political will to solve. So it stands to reason that it will get solved exactly at the time when it becomes too big to ignore, and with middling results. 80 years from now, unless we invent infinite clean energy, it is entirely likely that we will all use renevables, and environmentalists will whine about their low EROEI, and the harm their production causes, but it will still be more acceptable than the Earth cooking, and the air being toxic, so most people won\'t bother to do anything about it.  \n\n>-Population size. We will have 9 billion people in 2050.\n\nThat\'s like 1.4 billion more than what we already have. \n\nWhen the world\'s population was 2.5 billion in the 1950s, sci-fi writers wrote scary scenarios about a future where 8 billion overcrowded people are sharing rationed synthetic food, water and living spaces. \n\nThat has pretty much come to pass, yet the average westerner still lives in the same general kind of lifestyle, as in the 1950s, in the sense that we still live in private houses, eat actual food, and even have our own private bathrooms. \n\nCompared to that, why should an about 15% increase in population be seen as apocalyptic?\n\n> -Antibiotics not working\n\nIn this case, the utopian option would be if we found a catch-all cure for all ailments in the world, and usher in the era of practical immortality.\n\nThe dystopian option would be if we didn\'t fix the antipiotics crisis, and a new dark age of plagues and high mortality came. \n\nBut why do you think that fixing the antibiotics crisis while otherwise things stay as they are now, is less likely than these two options? \n\n> -Potential slowdown in science\n\nWhy is this even in a list of disasters? If anything, this is the perfect example of the fear that the world will be just \"meh\" in the next century. That we have to fix our most glaring problems with the imperfect solutions that are obviosus even now, but we won\'t spectacularly advance anywhere further.\n\n','76pg9u',0,0,0,0,NULL,0,0);

When you clean your house do you worry about using anti-bacterial substances to kill single or multi-cellular organisms? Are you a person with any issues about killing a bug that gets in your house? The argument really has to come to sentience, intelligence, autonomy... Because until that growing bundle of cells starts to develop a nervous system and brain, it really is nothing but growing cells. Cancer is a bundle of growing cells in a human body, but we don\'t have issue getting rid of those. Objectively and scientifically that is what they are, and though the debate of personhood has a lot deep philosophical implications, for myself and for all practical purposes, until about 22-25 weeks (the end of the first trimester and beginning of the second) into the gestation of the fetus the nervous system has not developed, and it cannot react to outside stimulus. Though the brain has formed in a rudimentary way before this, the connections between the cortex and the nerve endings developing in the body haven\'t been established. There are some fibres building, but that\'s about it. There\'s no autonomous action, no intelligence or thought, it really is just stem cells taking shape. Beyond that point, when the nervous system is solidifying and the infant can react to outside stimulus such as pain, I can agree with you there is an issue of personhood and sentient life. Before this point, it is arbitrary where you draw the line for \"personhood\". Are you of the opinion that \"every sperm is sacred\" and masturbation is genocide? Do you realise how many millions and billions of eggs and sperm are \"wasted\" every minute of the day because our body cells naturally die and get replaced? \n\nI see the \"bundle of cells\" argument to be one of the few that has no subjective mess. Is objectivity controversial? Yes. But it sits as a direct foil to the Pro-Life demonisation of murdering babies, which as you have said is a purely emotional and subjective statement. And here\'s the main point- after the first trimester it becomes increasingly risky to both mother and child to have an abortion, 91% of abortions are done in the first trimester for this reason. So the objective argument about developing cells really should hold more weight. You cannot \'murder\' something without personhood, without sentience or intelligence. If you\'re arguing instead for the \"chance\" to develop into life, then you yourself are moving away from a more objective and moderate stance and more towards a pro-life standpoint classifying life from an arbitrary point of conception.

Leave aside the issue of whether or not this philosophy\'s analysis of society is correct.  Please understand, I am only referring to the philosophy I describe in the title.\n\nI think all reasonable people can agree that success in life is based partly on the circumstances of your birth and partly on your actions.  By overplaying the role of race and sex in life success, leftists understate the amount of ambition and hard work needed to succeed.  If they aren\'t successful, they are likely blame the system rather than change their behavior.  If they are successful, they are likely to feel guilty about exploiting the system rather than using their experience to help others get where they are.\n\nLeftist culture demonizes capitalism, which is the mechanism by which one attains material security in our society.  Starting a business, investing your savings, or choosing a STEM career are things that can improve one\'s quality of life, but they are things that radical leftists will refuse to do.  The idea of formal education as self-improvement rather than an economic investment puts people into crippling debt.\n\nLeftists place people into categories, which damages their ability to connect to them as individuals.  There\'s a doctrine that describes certain categories as having legitimate complainst and anxieties, and other categories of being \"blinded by privilege\".  This will ruin their ability to connect to many of the people they will encounter in life.\n\nLeftists find ways to be angry about the most innocent things.  That delicious meal?  Full of pesticides.  That inspiring historical narrative?  Worthless because the characters may have been racist.  That cartoon you loved as a child?  Full of damaging stereotypes.  That sweet old man playing happily with a puppy?  Animal exploitation.  That woman taking comfort in her faith while she fights a terrible illness?  Grr, religion!\n\nI\'m sure to a certain extent these things are true about any radical philosophy, but I feel that my happiness and quality of life improved once I stopped looking at the world in a leftist way.\n\nPlease change my view.  If you are such a leftist, let me know what makes you happy, or what useful life skills you\'ve learned from your belief system.  If you see similar flaws in other beliefs, let me know.  Here goes nothing.\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We\'d just like to remind you of a couple of things.

This is simply a belief that I\'ve held for quite some time, based on my study of history and observation of present-day situations. Unfortunately I can\'t seem to bring this up without being called racist, so I\'m genuinely interested in hearing a sound argument that doesn\'t involve that logic. \n\nI believe that slavery gave African descendants a better future in the Americas (particularly the USA) than they would have otherwise had in Africa. \n\nAfrica was, and still is, a pretty awful place to live in. Between AIDS and other diseases, famine, civil unrest, inadequate healthcare, lack of electricity/water, and non-existent educational systems, shouldn\'t African Americans be glad that they are in America now and not Africa? Would today\'s African Americans not certainly be in a worse state if they had been born in Africa today? \n\nI\'m well aware that the initial slaves brought over had to suffer horrific atrocities and it is a tragedy that they had to be subjected to such immense terror. They clearly did not benefit. But their children? Or their grandchildren? The African Americans of today, aren\'t they better off because of slavery? \n\nSo that\'s about it, Change My View.\n\nEDIT: Wanted to point out that I\'m not a big fan of the hypothetical \"what if we hadn\'t gotten involved\" argument with Africa.

The temptation to duplicate them is strong.  Passwords can be easy to forget, easy to guess, and easy to steal.  Every online service needs to have a password reset procedure because it\'s so common to lose one of the many passwords you need to remember for all the different websites you go to.\n\nBetter alternatives are openid and one-time keys.  Openid allows you to use one login across sites, which solves the problem of having too many passwords to remember, and potentially allows new login technology to be implemented as it becomes availible.\n\nOne-time keys are nice, because even if you get tricked by a fake login form, or a keylogger, or something, the attacker won\'t be able to use the key you gave them.  Examples of this technology are yubikey and google authenticator.\n\nI know that password managers elminate some of the problems with passwords, but it would be better if we had a similar solution for one-time keys.\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

By making it expensive to hold on to land without using it, we could force those homes on to the market and make housing more affordable for everyone.\n\nSocially, this would be a way to resolve historical injustices.  In the US, land was taken from the Native Americans.  Countless countries all across the world have seen the exploitation of peasant farmers by wealthy landlords.  In Zimbabwe, the issue with the white farmers shows the disasterous consequences of simply redistributing that land.  At the same time, the new distribution is not necessarily more just.\n\nWith a land value tax, we could use a percentage of the proceeds to create a basic income, so that all people will share equally in the land wealth of a country, regardless of history.\n\nEDIT:  Forgot to mention that it\'s the least disruptive and most enforceable method of collecting tax I can think of.  Land can\'t be offshored or hidden.  It doesn\'t require a huge bureaucracy to spy on everyone\'s income.

The problem with an AI copying itself is not the that copy is not unique, it\'s that it becomes ambiguous whether or the obligations, crimes, and property of the original extend to the copy.

How many astrophysical phenomena were theorized from prior knowledge before they were observed in any real sense?  It doesn\'t matter how much data you have, you need at least some rationalism to make sense of it.\n\nOne of the most important principles of empiricism is that correlation is not causation.  In the physical sciences, researchers use controlled experiments to establish causation.  Specimens are randomly divided into experimental and control groups in order to ensure that, statistically, the only difference between the groups is the variable being studied.\n\nIn contrast, the \"natural experiments\" of economics have nothing like this.  The nature of economics requires us to compare societies that are different in every possible way, while they simultaneously interact in ways we can\'t always predict.  You\'re comparing economies with different populations, demographics, technology, industry, cultures, time, even weather. \n\nWhenever the evidence seems to contradict a given theory, advocates of the theory are always ready with explanations for how factors that weren\'t considered in the original projections changed the results.  These explanations are not necessarily wrong, but they show how hard it is to empirically falsify a macroeconomic theory.

E.g. \"Any Apple iPhone has to have this and that technical parameters\", or \"a My Little Pony product can\'t be unsuitable for 3-6 years old\", or \"any Coke drink has to be identified as equal in taste, to the control sample that we provide for comparison, by 90 out of 100 tasters\".

But if the product\'s relevant qualities are easily replicated, and it\'s not alread subject to patents or copyrights, then there is no public benefit from letting one company own it just because they happened to be first to use it.  \n\nThe benefits would be: \n\n1. The ereasure of a useless, non-productive marketing industry that is built around inflating brands\' net worth, through promting implied, unspecified values, that can only be cashed in thanks to the current trademark system.

This also causes problems for simple things like paying bills which are set to a fixed date.\n\nThe 13-month calendar would solve all those problems: 28 day months, four weeks per month, preserves all religious requirements and typical work-week regimens. Upon implementation Monday would always be the 1st, 8th, 15th, and 22nd of the month. You would never need to consult the calendar again. \n\nAs for day # 365 and possible leap days, make day 365 New Year\'s Day and an official holiday worldwide. If it\'s a leap year, add that as part of the holiday as well. For written purposes we could simply code it as 13/29-30, or isolate it as 14/1. These days would not be \"mondays\" or disrupt the calendar in any way.\n\nCan you think of any reasons why this wouldn\'t be better? Because most people I\'ve told have been giving me the \"that\'s stupid\" answer but nobody has yet to give me a decent rebuttal. \n\nAlso, I\'m aware that changing calendars would cost something. Please don\'t let that be your argument. I believe firmly that we could plan this years in advance, gradually updating software and preparing for the change, and it would cost us very little compared to what we\'d save in time and energy going forward. \n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

Anglish is an attempt to construct a version of English using only Anglo-Saxon and other Germanic roots.  The result is a language that not only sounds beautiful, but is much more intuitive to learn new vocabulary.\n\nTake, for example, this [list of lores](http://anglish.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_Lores).  Rather than using Greek-derived names for the sciences, which are completely meaningless to the average learner of English until they learn the name of that particular science, Anglish uses simple compounds from common, everyday words that language learners would already be familiar with.  Many languages do this as well.\n\nThe result of incorporating all these foreign words is that English no consistency of grammar, spelling, pronunciation, or anything.  This makes it more confusing and burdensome to learn.\n\nI should specify that I\'m speaking of a regulator with the goal of keeping English clear, consistent, and true to its roots.  Obviously, a language regulator that pushed for the inclusion of these foreign words would be no help.\n\nIt may be too late now, given the use of English as an international language, but I think it is a shame and a detriment to international communication that English wasn\'t standardized this way a long time ago.\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

And yet, the vast majority of people have no idea how to type without looking at the keys and often hunting and pecking. I personally consider this a major problem because I think it is holding us back to some extent.\n\nSome points that I use to support this argument:\n\n1. Faster typing = more productivity, businesses would benefit. You could do more paperwork, more homework, anything on the computer. I\'d argue that if everybody could type, we\'d all have more free time as well, or at the very least GDP would increase as we get more work done in less time. \n\n2. It\'s useful for personal and professional activities: Even if all you do is type posts on facebook and write an email to your grandkids, knowing how to type will help you.\n\n3. It\'s easy to learn. It\'s all muscle memory, and if you practiced for an hour a day you\'d be good in a month. Plus there are programs galore for it. \n\nSo, my view is that if university required you to know how to touch-type, perhaps with a modest WPM test on entry, or at least a freshman-year course, people would be forced to learn it and would become better typists, thus benefiting everyone down the line. \n\nWhy university? Because minimum wage workers don\'t usually need to type on a computer, making it less necessary at the high school level. Also, in university, you\'ll be typing a hell of a lot. I don\'t care what course you take, you\'ll need to type up essays and ultimately a thesis paper. \n\nAm I overblowing this? To quote the great Mugatu, I feel like I\'m taking crazy pills. To me it\'s at least as important as learning how to write with a pen these days. I\'d just like to understand why society currently seems to place no value in this skill, and that maybe I\'m overreacting. \n\n**Edit 1**\n\nWell, thanks for all the comments, it\'s been a very interesting discussion so far. \n\nThe argument that\'s hanging onto me the most is that the keyboard may become obsolete, but I can\'t see that happening soon enough to justify ignoring a useful skill.\n\nFor those who point out that we can learn it of our own free will and it\'s not the university\'s place, I feel that the long-term benefits of such a policy change benefit us in the long term. Universities often require you to study other things they feel are beneficial, such as learning another language (which is often taught inadequately), so I don\'t feel that it\'s outside the potential scope of a university to require typing.\n\nAnd for those pointing out that it isn\'t worth the time, I maintain that learning costs next to nothing, and it saves you time over the course of your life if you add up every time you type.\n\n**Edit 2, View Changed**\n\n/u/cheeseboyardee made the point that not everyone learns at the same rate and some people may not be able to learn to type well, and thus mandating it could exclude otherwise capable people. \n\nThanks for all the posts and cordial discussion. \n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

I feel this is very detrimental to almost any cause for a multitude of reasons.\n\nFirst, it comes off as antagonistic. I very do much feel that when trying to change someone\'s view you have to be willing to work with them. While being sarcastic and snarky may make you feel good because you\'ve done this spiel a bunch already, they haven\'t heard it the same amount. It just makes people disinterested in your cause and likely won\'t go and \"educate themselves\".\n\nSecondly, by telling people to educate themselves, you leave what they discover and the conclusions they come to by themselves. And while ideally this is a great outcome, it\'s not so great when you are trying to change societal views. You give these people the ability to go and find any source they want, to come to any conclusion you want and you have to ask how likely is it that they are going to get to the outcome you desire? \n\nThird, it\'s quite contrary to any form of activism out there. Activism is designed around changing views, amassing a group of people to help change the world. By delegating the informing process to the individuals and not yourself your not really doing anything of note. You get to feel good because you have the \"right view\" and don\'t have to do anything with that knowledge outside of telling people they are wrong. It\'s back patting instead of actually trying to make change, and the amount of people saying it really puts a hamper on any attempts towards progress.\n\nOverall, it\'s a phrase that makes you feel good, but it\'s not something that actually helps and is likely to actually make more opponents than any supporters.\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

All of these other areas cause similar harm to the harm caused by beauty standards.','I see there are several posts relating to beauty standards-- eg questioning whether there is a real gender disparity, questioning whether prominently displayed beautiful women cause harm to young women, and so forth. But I had a thought today that immediately resonated as true with me, so until it is addressed, I have tentatively accepted it as my own view.\n\nFirst, let me be clear: I definitely believe that models set an unrealistic beauty standard. Very few people could ever look like them, and they are held up as examples of what we should all aspire to. I also believe these standards are more selectively applied to women-- ie, nearly all females chosen to represent an organization are attractive, and only most males are so. And I think this can cause harm by driving young people to either harm themselves to achieve those standards, or to be unhappy with themselves if they can\'t.\n\nBut something else occurred to me today. Aren\'t the same dynamics in play with success everywhere?\n\nTo take one example, let\'s consider military leaders or boardroom executives. I could never stand in front of other people and make tough calls in the heat of the moment. I\'m not a military commander type; I am self-doubting and mull over data. Even if I\'m confident, people won\'t follow me, because I don\'t present myself well. I\'m not persuasive.\n\nAnd it really destroys my self-esteem to recognize these facts. Yeah, I try to tell myself it\'s okay; not everyone is a leadership type, there\'s other roles to be played. But in truth, life is nearly always better for leadership types. It\'s not just in the boardroom or on the battlefield, but when choosing a restaurant to eat at with friends, when trying to tell a story to peers, etc.\n\nHow about intelligence? I\'m not stupid; I\'m a veterinarian, that\'s something. But I finished in the bottom 25% of my class. I constantly see veterinarians publishing case studies and experimental reports, they have PhD\'s in addition to their DVMs, they recall information they heard only once in a lecture 25 years ago to help them solve a case; meanwhile I have to look up the dose of the drug I just used 2 hours ago, because I already forgot. Some of my former classmates go to other countries and hey, give them 5 months and they\'ve learned a new language, and now they\'re volunteering to help people out of poverty. \n\nEven something like musical talent-- I mean, I play several instruments, but I have a terrible voice, I have a decent ear but nowhere near the level of even the shitty local garage band members, and so on. I have friends with perfect pitch who can sing a note by name and name a note that you play without any reference point.\n\nAll of these things are examples of human exceptionalism. All of them can be improved through work, but have a large basis in genetics and early childhood environment. And most of us cannot achieve these things, but are constantly bombarded by recordings, broadcasts, and writing about people who can. And isn\'t it true that the low self-esteem that a lot of people have, the insecurity, and the problems that result from that, are widespread? \n\nI think the harm caused by examples of exceptional human being is similar, whether that exceptionalism is in the area of beauty, social ability, intelligence, athletic ability, or any human characteristic that is based on a mixture of genetic ability and environment, and to a lesser degree, choices made as adults or young adults.\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

Well, so is \"friend\", \"visitor\", \"baby\", \"mother\", \"alive\", \"dead\", and many others.  There are many words which can describe both humans and non-humans.\n\nI feel that the real reason traditionally neutral words like \"female\" draw a negative reaction is because more politically correct words are used as a shibboleth.

I also use Western to describe North America and Europe, as that is where that the discussions of gender equality as that is most people who would visit this site come from\n\nOur fight for gender equality that has been one extremely biased in propping up women\'s issues to the forefront. This has succeeded in many aspects, but at this point in time, we still are propping up women\'s issues while ignoring the issues that men face, even to the extent society will tend to laugh and scoff at individuals who try to bring attention to these issues or feel that by doing so they are harming women. This is especially an issue since I find that the issues that plague men to be categorically worse than the current issues being lobbied by the current and biggest group considered for equal rights between the genders, feminism.\n\nThe issues generally propped up by feminism are either lies through statistics (wage gap being the collective difference between men and women and presenting as being the difference between a man and a woman doing the same job) or very much focused on attitudes and roles perceived to be held against women.  The biggest issue I see propped up by feminism is abortion, however abortion is typically a service that is available to some extent in most western nations legally. As such discussions are about making it more accessible or in its defence as opposed to trying to legalize it. These issues are okay to discuss and I do agree with quite a lot of them, but they seem somewhat minuscule an issue in comparison to the state of men.\n\nMen\'s issues not only incorporate aspects such as attitudes and roles held against men, but also several issues I find to be very pressing and some that show just a general imbalance between genders. \n\nMajor issues I see that face men is right now the amount of boys failing in education. This is an alarming trend where boys are consistently doing worse in schools and the gap between boys and girls is continuing to become larger as Women make up a majority of students in college and university. This is a pressing issue as it presents that something in education has changed that has caused this decrease of success in boys and that we are currently actively harming lots of boys by continuing as such.\n\nAnother issue is arrest and incarceration rates between the genders. While men do tend to commit more violent crimes then women, there is a large trend of women getting lighter sentences than men for committing the same crimes. This not only shows preferential bias either towards women or against men, it also brings up the issue of why these men are committing crimes at such a large rate. When we view crime in relation to poverty, we tend to understand that environment and circumstance is involved, but that appears rarely discussed when discussing why men commit crime in comparison towards women.\n\nWorking off the previous point, there is serious lack of support for men as well in comparison to women. We have countless state and government funded shelters for women, yet none for men. It reminds me of the incident of Earl Silverman, a man who funded a male domestic violence shelter out of his pocket and desperately tried to get Canadian government funding, but couldn\'t due to domestic violence being under women\'s issues and the women\'s issues department not having men under their jurisdiction. He attempted to sue, but could not sue the government as there was no department he could sue. He eventually ran out of funding and had to close the shelter down and eventually committed suicide. We view domestic violence as being a women\'s issue despite statistics implying they are roughly 50/50 (with a majority of cases having both parties being abusive), yet we use the Duluth model which states an arrest must be made for calls of domestic violence and has led to countless male victims being arrested due to it. Men do not have the support of the police, of shelters, or even of their peers, and often stay in these relationships because they have children they want to protect from the abuse of their mothers.\n\nThese are just some of the tips of the issues I find that men have, others including the struggle men have with parental rights (both in keeping them and relinquishing them), the pushes of Yes means Yes laws which reverses the burden of proof to the defendant to prove they got consent, circumcision being legal while FGM is not, men being tied to drafts while women typically are not, suicide rates of men (even if women are counted as attempting more, people who fail get help), increased homelessness rates for men, etc.\n\nAll of these issues to me seem categorically worse issues faced almost exclusively to men than issues faced by women. It just appears to be a fact that men are worse off then women in current western society contrary to what is often presented by the media.\n\nSo I ask for you to change my view, to either try and convince me that issues that men face in western society to the issues faced by women are a lot more equivalent than I presented, or that women face worse issues than men. \n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

I have my own doubts about aspects of religion but I choose to believe because I find it being more beneficial for me than to not believe. \n\nThis is largely due to belief in aspects of afterlife. If were an atheist, death would mean that I would stop existing, this thought is just one I cannot fathom no matter how much I try. Our entire understanding of life is based around how we perceive it, and if we stop perceiving, we stop existing. The one way I\'ve interacted with the world is gone, I no longer exist. I cannot even begin to imagine what not existing is even like since it is a state of absence. How can you imagine nothing when you have no framework for it? Death terrifies me when I think like that. Even if all my issues stop existing, I don\'t exist to even acknowledge that, I get erased. \n\nBy being a theist, even if I doubt it\'s validity, I can believe there is something that exists for me after such an event. It allows me to not worry about what I said above. Even if it\'s an eternal torture, it sounds so much better than to not even exist. And if I\'m wrong in my beliefs and there is nothing for me, my existence has already stopped and I won\'t have to deal with anything any more because I can\'t.\n\nWhile it may be very personal in how I perceive death, I don\'t see any harm in believing in an afterlife as any harm that could come from it happens at a point where you no longer exist. If that\'s the case I don\'t see why every person who has some doubt or worry about death shouldn\'t believe in something.\n\nEdit: I have opened up my views so I\'m mostly changed in my view from the absolute nature I framed it as. I can see athiests having those beliefs that I did not believe they could and that others could potentially have a reverse frame to me, were the idea of an afterlife is frightening.\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

She has written the book \"The war against boys\" showing her beliefs about the ways that society is currently harming boys, another called \"Who Stole Feminism\", and has a video series on youtube which she calls \"The Factual Feminist\", declaring an approach to feminism that looks at the facts in an honest light.\n\nDue to her voicing her issues with modern feminism, many have started to label her as being \"anti-feminist\" (with wikipedia providing sources for some such claims https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christina_Hoff_Sommers). This is a view that I have issues with. \n\nCHS is an individual who still calls herself feminist and I feel that is the most important aspect here. Even if one believes her views line up with people who do call themselves anti-feminist, her views come from a different place. I don\'t think many anti-feminists want to be feminists, they would likely rather replace feminism with another equality movement. CHS comes from a place of reforming feminism, criticizing it to make it better. At the core of her view is a support for feminism, wanting to create a better movement, and if that is a view that is considered anti-feminist, I have to question whether feminism is accepting of criticism. \n\nThis leads into another slight. I often see feminists say feminism is full of self-criticism and disagreement, that they disagree on what it means to be feminist all the time. If feminism is willing to accept such contradictory beliefs under it\'s banner, why is CHS\'s beliefs an exception? If feminism can have sex-positive and sex-negative feminists and collectivist and individualist feminists, why not a critical one? This seems somewhat odd to me.\n\nThere is also an issue of feminist\'s saying feminism is the belief for women\'s rights, or equality or some other similar definition. This usually encompasses a bunch of people who say they aren\'t feminists, with feminists saying they are feminists already. If one person is willing to call themselves feminist, why try and deny them that label? Her criticism is based on the actions of the movement, and for that she gets labeled anti-feminist. This seems very misguided and leads to similar issues above and seems to work towards proving CHS\'s beliefs that feminism needs some reform.\n\nI just don\'t see how someone who claims to be a feminist can be denied the label when the label is either so broad a definition as to basically mean nothing, or one that is strict but contradictory. Neither scenario seems acceptable, so to call CHS anti-feminist seems contradictory.\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

This seems as though its continuing to grow and will likely not stop until the movement gets a large overhaul in it\'s beliefs.\n\nTo start social justice is a phrase that was always somewhat weird to me. I ask why is it called that, what exactly is desired as \"justice\"? And more and more, it seems to want to make revenge their goal in determining what justice is, to reflect how our courts deal justice, in sentencing those who have committed crimes.\n\nNow while that first thought may just be my own thoughts, it sure seems as though plenty ideas of thought sure permeate common social justice attitudes.\n\nTo start, there seems to be a huge a huge attitude of there being two groups, and it\'s acceptable to encourage one way animosity. This seems to show itself in ideas such as \"punching up\" where it is deemed acceptable for those who are below to attack up at those above them. This seems all too prevalent in a lot of the work, especially when applied in conjunction with the social justice use of racism where I have seen people say \"my prejudice is okay because it\'s based in fact and isn\'t racism\". There\'s a bunch of stuff like all those \"male tears\" merchandise that is sold and bought and it just seems so against what I consider in bringing people up. This is a clear acceptance of these attitudes to me and I don\'t see how much good can come out from allowing them to flourish in a movement that is apparently designed to help make everyone equal.\n\nThen there is the very common \"Oppressed and the Oppressor\" discussions that go along in such circles which I don\'t see doing any help into trying to get people to work together. All it does is force people to think of themselves as oppressed and look to the oppressors as their enemies. When you breed entire groups of people as enemies, you aren\'t wanting to help them, you wan\'t to tear them down, bring them down, they have wronged you so now they must face justice. There is just way too much blame and hate that permeates the entire underlying of the ideology behind social justice and it just seems to be becoming more and more of an issue as the lines of where people stand become more prominent as these groups enter the spotlight.\n\nIt just seems to me that the social justice goal of equality is emphasized through privilege. Whenever I look at privilege as used by social justice, it\'s used to say being treated decently is a privilege. It says that because other people may be treated worse, you\'re level of not being treated badly (and not even beneficially) is a privilege. This becomes an issue just when you examine the general reaction to the term privilege, people don\'t like the privileged. Privileged is viewed as undeserved, as unfair. People tend to not like being called privileged (hence why there always seem to be an inherent backlash whenever someone calls another person privileged). To be treated with some bare amount of respect is considered to be privileged while the lowest of the low are considered the default. \n\nCombine this attitude with the quite often Marxist view that is used by these groups, and you see the proposed solution as being to bring everyone down to create equality, instead of bringing people up to create equality. This all seems somewhat exemplified in a discussion I saw where a feminist said they would rather have both the rich and poor be poorer if it meant a lower gap in between the two groups, than have both be overall wealthier but the gap being much larger. That the better solution is to tear down those above than bring up those below.\n\nRight now I just see compassion for the disadvantaged created through equivalent animosity to the advantaged when one follows the social justice school of thought. I see this as being a ground where people would rather use revenge to solve their issues than work out something beneficial to everyone. The attitudes and rhetoric used by these groups all seem to work towards doing such things and this is just not going to lead to a world where everyone is better off. Change my view.\n\nEdit: I got to take a break, just way too much and I\'ve basically spent the last 5 hours straight just trying to respond to people. Sorry.\n\nEdit: I guess there are some aspects of my view that has been changed now. I suppose I was being a bit too broad in how I initially described the topic, so that is my fault. I\'ve also somewhat opened up to privilege, but just in a way that fits my view point already. I think I have to stop again because this topic took a lot more of my time than I would have liked. Thank you everyone for participating though even if I still may disagree in parts.\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

I however feel that to advance our understanding of how humans and other animals work, we should continue to understand these concepts, not only to know why, but to help people as well (mostly in regards to gender here).\n\nTo explain a bit more, we have a concept of what gender is, but we don\'t really know exactly how it works, whether if it\'s something very social, whether it\'s something somewhat inherent to the sex of a brain, whether it\'s how a mind reacts to hormones or any other possible explanation. I do find this a somewhat important topic to understand as the only way we know how to treat cases of gender dysphoria has been to do an irreversible and expensive process of SRS. By understanding how exactly gender works, we can potentially come up with a cheaper and/or better solution to dealing with such issues that could address the route of the problem.\n\nThis however all revolves around what we could find as the cause of gender. In general, I\'m more inclined to believe that biological aspects play a larger part in gender than sociological (due to trans people and cases of people being raised as the opposite gender). This makes me come to two possible explanations, that gender is somewhat inherent to how the brain is constructed or the one that I feel is more likely, how the brain perceives different levels of hormones and whatnot. If it were the first case, it would seem unfeasible for anything but SRS to be considered a solution as changing the brain does not seem ethical or plausible. However if it\'s due to a balance issue, it could be possible to address issues such as gender dysphoria without altering the body in major and potentially unnecessary ways. Our deeper understanding of the concept would also allow us to consider whether such a potential solution would be ethical or not depending on how important gender is to what we consider to compose our minds and whether such an altercation would drastically change a person to the point where we opt out of considering it an option to alter it.\n\nIt\'s for those reasons listed above that I feel we should continue delving into these topics because not only does it inform us about how an important aspect of our identity works, it could help a lot of people either through treatment or protecting the importance of gender.\n\nSo in short, to change my view I would guess either showing that research into these subjects are still going strong and unhindered and I\'m simply uninformed on the situation (which would be more likely) or that we should not advance our understanding into these subjects (less likely).\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

Education ends up becoming the foundation of any job or position afterwards, and if the education is going mostly to a certain demographic (whether unfair or not) that is going to have an affect on which people are going into which jobs. So if that is the solution that is determined to be useful I\'m mostly fine with that.\n\nHowever, my issues with the system becomes very apparent after education has occurred. At such a point the education should have been able to take route, allowing anyone attempting for a position to now be on similar grounds having gone through the required education. There is no need to decide based on factors outside of ability as the factor that affirmative action attempts to solve should already be accounted for.\n\nBasically affirmative action at the level of education solves the issue that affirmative action at later stages attempts to do, turning it literally into a quota.\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

The federal government having economic and especially social control over the rest of the country is terrible and it creates unrest and polarization. When 51% of a nation is able to force their will on the 49%, that\'s a problem. When you have to send in lobbyist to the federal government to make sure your interest aren\'t ignored in favor of others, that\'s a problem. When the federal government can make social laws that effect all of society and our culture, that\'s a problem.\n\n\nWhy can\'t we just say something like; if California wants to legalize gay marriage - fine, if Utah doesn\'t - fine, if Minnesota wants to take their government out of marriage completely - fine, if some other state wants to do something else - whatever - just pay your federal taxes.\n\n\nOr; if Oregon wants to institute socialist policies - fine, if Kansas wants to institute a more capitalist system - fine, if Washington wants to do whatever - fine - just pay your federal taxes.\n\nOr; if Nevada wants a Grecian democracy - fine, if Nebraska wants a monarch - fine, if New Jersey wants a republic - fine, if New York wants an Aristocracy - fine - just send representatives to the Senate and the House.\n\nIf Connecticut wants the strictest gun laws ever (that don\'t infringe on the 2nd amendment) - fine. If Texas wanted the most lax gun laws ever - fine - whatever happens is Texas\' problem. If Arizona wanted to lie somewhere in between - fine. Let the states deal with whatever the consequences are for their laws.\n\nIf Mississippi wants to provide state (not federal gov) funded social programs to people - fine. If Georgia doesn\'t - fine; don\'t stay in Georgia if you\'re poor. If Alabama wants to allow non-profits to undertake the task of servicing the poor for the state - fine.\n\nThis should go right down to the cities and neighborhoods!

Why do we have to pressure states to succumb to outside values and look down at Texas, Oklahoma, or whatever the state was for not liking gay marriage? Why can\'t we just let people be and live in (and maintain) societies that they\'re comfortable with? In that scenario, if you don\'t like the policies, the people, the culture, or whatever in a state - you go to one that suits you better. Now, American states are almost culturally and legally homogenous.\n\nWhy can\'t we just let states and municipalities do whatever suits their people and values best as long as they pay their taxes, send in reps, and don\'t try to secede? Why is the federal government trying to make states\' decisions for them and why do so many Americans act like they like this?

Then someone a part of the movement/religion/social group/etc. states:\n\n \"Not all feminists/MRAs/Muslims/Christians/BLM activists/gay rights activists/etc. are like that!\" \n\nWhat happens next is people telling them something like:\n\n\"Well, if you\'re not all like that, the ones are that are rational/peaceful/intelligent/kind/etc. need to speak up and put an end to it!\"\n\nI think that this argument does not consider just how effective groupthink is on someone\'s willingness to come forward. If they do speak up against the stereotype (i.e. \"I am a feminist that is not misandrist\"), they could face backlash from the very group that they are a part of. That is inconvenient at best, downright scary at worst when you think of losing a group that you may have grown close to. Because people don\'t want to lose whatever bonds they may have in feminism/the MRM/Islam/the Democratic Party/etc., they won\'t speak out. \n\nAlso, rational/peaceful/intelligent/kind/etc. people often don\'t naturally attract as much attention as those that are irrational/violent/unintelligent/mean-spirited/etc. The media need to stir up emotion within the people in order to make money. It is easy to get people upset, and nothing gets people more upset than Muslims burning a woman alive/Christians slighting gays/feminists acting out against men/etc. Media outlets that generate discussion generate money. Creating outrage is an easy way to start discussion and thus, make money.\n\nTo further elaborate on my point of rational people attracting less attention, the radicals \"scream louder\". They appear to others to be speaking with more conviction, which garners the attention of different groups largely because they are much easier to see. This also may be because people notice unusual things more than commonplace things. Many people would say that radicals are the fringe of their movement/religion/group. It would follow that evangelical Christians would get more attention than the more level-headed ones, or that the misogynist MRAs would get more attention than the rational ones, etc. If most of a group was radical, then shouldn\'t the rational ones be getting more attention?\n\nI believe that confirmation bias is another contributing factor to this. A lot of people may say that they would like to see a rational feminist/MRA/Christian/BLM activist/etc., but when one presents themselves, many of those same people that were asking for a level-headed person don\'t want to partake in a dialogue. A lot of people that subscribe to an ideology don\'t like to have their beliefs challenged. People that are a part of a social movement, or religion, or other organized group, often have a lot of pride of being tied to that movement. It\'s easier to take on a crazy caricature of a group than it is to take on the reasonable people. If they do engage with the rational people, they run the risk of \"losing\" the argument. This has the power to embarrass someone. To someone that is/was on the fence, they would likely view the \"loser\" as being irrational anyways and thus, the invisibility of the rational people continues.\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

Why not just sing \"hey, Christmas is around the corner, tell everyone you love them!\" It was put in a song about death because it\'s an attempt to beat it back. I think that the reason these messages are so prominent in modern media is because the produces of those media believe they can fight back their own mortality through this work. They can\'t quite solve the problem on their own, but they think they can find a noble purpose in life by solving it for other people… without realizing that the message fails regardless of whose ears it hits. I think producers of media and narratives should just give it a rest and go back to entertaining us.\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

Divorce rates are at an all time high, less people are getting married and there really seems to be less and less benefits to such a union as society continually changes. \n\nMarriage as a concept was essentially a system to help the human species survive. It provided children support from both parents, it provided women a guarantee of support from a husband and insured men that the women they are dedicating their support is exclusive. This system worked in time when there was less safety overall (both health and physical) and seemed generally okay.\n\nSociety has however increased it\'s standards drastically. Safety is less of an issue and the roles of both genders has changed drastically. The foundations of what has made marriage a viable model has been completely changed yet the model itself has had very little done to it itself (outside of allowing more people to use it). As it stands, it\'s a tool that addresses the flaws of a past society but is now becoming a flaw in the current now.\n\nAs it stands, it\'s bounding people longer than it has before (due to increases in how long people live along with societies changing of how it treats relationships), it is designed as a support system for one person who doesn\'t provide revenue when a majority of marriages have both doing so (leading to some very unfair divorce settlements), and the support of the child has been steadily growing towards single parents due to the failures of marriage as it stands.\n\nI just don\'t see how marriage is really in anyway addressing any of the issues that relationships have in today\'s society and through it trying to solve issues of the past society creates new ones in our current one. So is there something I\'m missing in how the current system is working to benefit people that shows the concept doesn\'t need addressing?\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

Killing an innocent ~~person~~ human is wrong\n2. A foetus is innocent\n3. A foetus is a ~~person~~ human\n\nIf i prove these individually, it follows that abortion is wrong.\n\n**Fringe case where some of the above premises may not apply**\n\n* Killing an innocent person may not be considered wrong if inaction is likely to result in the death of both parties. I.e. If there is a threat to the life of the mother, abortion *may* not be wrong as inaction would result in the death of both the mother and the foetus.\n\n* I use *may* because the above case is a grey area; obviously, the threat would need to be clear, present and direct. Coming up with a non-arbitrary quantum for this is a challenge\n\n**1 - Killing an innocent person is wrong**\n\nTo determine whether something is wrong, we need to come to some basic understanding of what \"right\" and \"wrong\" means in the context of a western secular democracy.\n\nOur legal system has a term for the pre-meditated killing of an innocent person - murder. Most moral frameworks hold the killing of an innocent person to be the height of immorality. \n\nOne common argument for abortion is that it reduces crime and is \"better off\" for the child in the long run, particularly if they are born into poverty - this is a utilitarian moral perspective. I\'ll address this point now. Obviously, there *are* times where killing an innocent person may be considered acceptable. The most obvious example is a drone or missile strike, where there is a statistical likelihood that there will be civilian collateral damage - war is still pursued for \"the greater good\". These are rare, and avoided like a plague, but they do happen. \n\nThis isn\'t a valid example of one of those cases, because, if my other two points are true, then one could just as easily apply this argument to children, or adolescents or even adults. If killing an innocent person is justified because it might prevent crime in a very indirect and abstract sense, then why not enforce the death penalty for all crimes? Moreover, this utilitarian calculus is very rare in western societies, where we tend to prioritize individual rights and dignity over net social outcomes.\n\n**2 - A foetus is innocent**\n\nObviously, a foetus is innocent in the sense that they haven\'t committed any wrongs that society would consider worthy of death. I live in a country without the death penalty and without \"stand your ground\" or \"castle\" laws, there is absolutely no situation where the state can kill an innocent person. \n\nThere is a pro abortion argument that centre\'s around this premise:\n\n* A foetus is violating a woman\'s bodily autonomy \n * Consensual sex - if a woman chose to have sex, with or without contraception, then she consented to the possibility that she could become pregnant. She is therefore responsible for giving birth to the child. In a similar vein, if you sign up for a mortgage, then you consent to giving up your autonomy to labour without compensation. \n* Rape - this is still wrong, because killing an innocent person is wrong. It is perhaps *legally* ambiguous because of the issue of consent and potential mental health problems\n\n**3 -  A foetus is a ~~person~~ human**\n\nThis is a big part of the argument. Firstly, some context. People have been using the \"oh; $x isn\'t *really* a person\" and dehumanization more generally to justify atrocities for a long, long time. The US used it to justify slavery, the Nazi\'s used it to justify the holocaust. I\'ll break this down into 2 broad concepts, humanity and personhood.\n\n1. Humanity - the accepted, scientific litmus test to determine whether something is a member of a particular species is to determine whether the thing in question is an independent organism (in the most basic sense, not independent as in \"can survive outside the womb\" sense) AND whether it is genetically a member of the species in question. This test eliminates the sperm cell and skin cell reductio ad absurdum arguments:\n\n* A sperm cell only contains half of the genetic information required for it to be considered human\n* A Skin cell isn\'t an independent organism, it is part of a larger organism\n\n2. Personhood - the entire notion of personhood is completely arbitrary. People attribute significance to \"consiousness\", \"viability\", \"intelligence\" and \"heartbeats\". Obviously, there is no discrete point where a foetus transitions from a non-human to a human. None of you will argue this, you\'ll argue that it\'s some sort of spectrum. This begs the question; if there is a \"spectrum\" of personhood\", baby who lacks the intelligence, independence and even consciousness (to some degree) of a child \"less of a person\"? Is a child \"less of a person\" than an adolescent? \n\nThe only way you can argue that a foetus isn\'t a person is if you create some sort of \"model\" of what a person is, and a set of attributes that you can test for. Is it having a heartbeat? Well, lot\'s of animals have heartbeats, and they not only more valuable than a human foetus but also entitled to basic rights. What about consiousness, empathy, intelligence? Again, these are attributes that a baby lacks and that certain animals possess, yet we obviously value a human baby more than an intelligent pig.\n\nThe salient point is that personhood is arbitrary, and the only significant question is humanity.\n\n\nSince a foetus is an innocent ~~person~~ human, and since killing an innocent person is wrong, abortion is wrong.\nq.e.d.\n\nI\'d like to find out if i\'ve made a mistake in framing this problem, or haven\'t properly proven one of the components - CMV\n\nEDIT: Clarified personhood issue - \n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

This is a bad thing','Modern culture, especially intellectual culture, laughs at the dark ages where the heliocentric model of the universe was dismissed without debate for merely challenging people\'s preconceived beliefs of what was the center of the universe, but yet we toss out ideas, whether correct or incorrect, true or false without debate today in 2016 just like the intellectuals of the day tossed out the heliocentric model of the universe. Just like they tossed out ideas for being un-Christian without investigating to see if they were true or false, certain descriptors are tossed around to silence debate such as racist, sexist, homophobic, etc. rather than actually looking at the merits of whether there is truth behind it. \n\nThe goal of any debate or any modern, civilized culture should be to find truth. It should not matter if that truth is racist, homophobic, xenophobic, or whatever else society deems as against their preconceived notions. What should matter is whether it is correct and whether it is true. As such, dismissing an argument simply because its \"racist\" or otherwise challenges your beliefs is unacceptable in a modern, civilized culture. The argument should be weighed on its own merits, it should be accepted if it is true or rejected if it is false. But, in modern culture that\'s not addressed, either an argument or belief is simply rejected based on pre-conceived notions or they fail to use occam\'s razor when discussing it and bring in multiple assumptions to try to justify the observation with their own worldview. This failure of debate is especially present on Reddit and most of the media, for example, back when /r/coontown existed, there was very little honest debate on there despite the admins actively encouraging it, most of the comments were combated not with facts and figures but mere emotions. \n\nThe fact that something is racist, xenophobic, homophobic, etc. is absolutely irrelevant to the goal of debate in a civilized culture which is to reason and to find truth. Now, it may very well come in through the matter of reason and debate that it shows that those comments and views are untrue, but dismissing them because it makes you uncomfortable does not make those arguments invalid. \n\nIt is my belief that dismissing these viewpoints without seeing whether the positions are true or false is the modern day equivalent to dismissing the heliocentric view of the solar system because it was un-christian. This post is not to debate race, homosexuality, national origin, etc. but rather a debate on the modern dismissal of ideas that make people uncomfortable. \n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

However, I feel that this particular quote kind of misses the mark.\n\nThe thing is, American comedy is full of comedic protagonists who \"life craps on\".  It\'s very common for them are \"loser\" archetypes who work lousy jobs, take embarrassing and painful pratfalls, and get rejected by women.  If it\'s a movie, they\'ll usually get a happy ending, but usually after being put through the ringer for the sake of comedy.\n\nWhen I watch British comedy, the main difference I see is that the British protagonists usually cause their own problems.  The American heros have minor flaws, like laziness, naiveté, or over-enthusiasm which make them more relatable and sympathetic.  The British heroes are often terrible people.  Narcissistic, deceitful, cowardly, and selfish.  It\'s usually less \"life\" that brings them down so much as their own flaws.\n\nI feel that the main reason the American protagonists usually succeed is because they\'re usually people we relate to and want to see succeed.  This may indeed speak to American optimism, as Fry suggests, but I feel he\'s wrong to generalize the comedic heroes as being above it all.\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

I see signs advocating the repeal of the SAFE act on a epic CRAPLOAD of houses. Now I personally don\'t own any of these crazy murder machines (ie. modded fire arms or assault rifles ect.) I do however own a .22 and an antiques 12 gauge left to me by my grandfather. However I found myself thinking about how these laws have come into effect and why they are there. From my own surmise, these laws came to be to protect people. More importantly to eliminate or limit the possession of fire arms that are capable of injuring/killing others en masse. I\'m thinking of public school shootings or shootings that have occurred at movie theaters generally a public place where large quantities of people gather at one time. Now how do laws such as this protect anyone? First off if someone is trying to commit mass murder or mass injurious harm to others, they obviously have no intent on obeying the laws already in place rendering these things illegal. So how is creating a law that attempts to limit a person\'s access to these weapons going to prevent him/her from obtaining one anyways and breaking another law on top of numerous others? They are already committed to killing or injuring a mass of people for whatever reason or purpose and will most likely spend the rest of their life in prison/sentenced to death or shot to death by the authorities. In essence they have created LAWS to prevent CRIMINALS from committing acts that are ILLEGAL. Is there something I am missing here? I don\'t see a logical reason to eliminate the ability for people to obtain assault weapons when someone who is intent on breaking the law is going to do just that anyways. There are other numerous points of the NY SAFE act I can agree with however these are the few I do not see the point of.\n\nBroadens definition of \"assault weapon\" from two identified features to one. The sale and/or transfer of newly defined assault weapons is banned within the state, although sales out of state are permitted. Possession of the newly defined assault weapons is allowed only if they were possessed at the time that the law was passed, and must be registered with the state within one year.\n\nBy making it illegal to buy these types of weapons you have created a very lucrative black market, especially around where I live. Is it illegal? Sure. However tell me I couldn\'t go to a bigger city and buy one with the serial scratched off it ready to implement someone\'s ill will. You\'ve effectively limited the law abiding citizens, well done. \n\nAmmunition dealers are required to do background checks, similar to those for gun buyers. Dealers are required to report all sales, including amounts, to the state. Internet sales of ammunition are allowed, but the ammunition will have to be shipped to a licensed dealer in New York state for pickup. Ammunition background checks were scheduled to begin January 15, 2014,[11] but were put on hold indefinitely because the required \"seamless\" technology that would not inconvenience vendors or customers could not be put in place. The superintendent of state police, charged with creating such technology, is working on development, but a release date is still unknown.[12] So while out-of-state vendors are required to ship ammunition to a NYS licensed dealer, the buyer can still pick it up with no check of any kind required, or walk into any registered ammunition dealer (now required under the act to sell ammunition) and buy ammunition providing he/she is over 18.\n\nAlthough not implemented (yet) still stupid in the sense that yu are creating a black market for fire arm ammunition for those unable to pass a background check.

However, from an outside and purely analytical standpoint, it seems like the general solution to such a conflict would be for the person who prefers open relationships to stay exclusive than to ask the exclusive preferring member to accept a partners open relationship.\n\nNow my main approach to this topic is through analyzing what exactly a romantic relationship is doing. In an ideal exclusive romantic relationship the main idea is that both members are providing support to each other, both physical and emotional. They are there for each other in their times of needs, they help each other out, there provide comfort, etc. They give all they have to support each other and in return are supported by their partner\'s full extent. But when I look at a relationship where one desires to have an open relationship with one who is exclusive, they are asking for everything from this individual but then splitting what they give up between multiple people. The closed individual is giving everything while receiving a fraction, while the open individual is giving a fraction (because they have to give to their other relationships) and receiving everything (plus what they receive from their other relationships). This is just a large imbalance that is quite unfair on the closed individual as they give their all but due not receive their partner\'s all back.\n\nThen there is considering the idea that the closed individual instead try to become open to balance out the imbalance mentioned above, but this still also feels unfair for the closed individual to an extent. To ask a person who is closed to expand their comfort zone seems like a bigger task than asking an open individual to restrict theirs. It seems to force the closed individual to go into multiple relationships to just get the same thing out of their relationship when they don\'t want to instead of just asking the open individual to just focus everything back onto the person giving to them. \n\nJust trying to rationalize the way relationships works, it just seems very difficult for me to rationalize a scenario were a closed individual does not have a severe disadvantage in such a relationship and that the person who wants an open one is just trying to get as much as they can while giving less back. It just seems fair to say that the open person should become closed since in that scenario, both members are now equal in what they give and receive (I repeat, under ideal circumstances) instead of one where one is disadvantaged. \n\nAgain, I\'m not saying this is how everyone needs to come to a conclusion as each relationship is different, some people will give less than they receive, and several other factors. It just seems that logically, the sacrifice should usually be on the individual who wants an open relationship.\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

Ideally, I\'d like abortion to only be acceptable in cases of rape (where one did not consent to the act of sex) or a case where the pregnancy threatens the life of the mother. I tend to think that even with using protection (with morning after pill fitting in this category since I know some will probably call even that abortion), one understands there is a chance of failure and a child may result and that is the consequence of their actions and should not purposefully deny a being a chance at life like that. However, due to issues that are involved in proving rape (so it would be impossible to really prove that rape occurred to allow abortion) as well as bodily autonomy to an extent (though this is arguably very little in my opinion), abortion should be available to the public.\n\nNow onto the bulk of my view, I absolutely despise the abortion debate. Both sides act like they have the moral high ground and that the other side is essentially evil. They take the topic to such extremes that they have made a grounds were no progress can even really be attempted to come to a solution.\n\nYou have one side, Pro-life, that treats the other as murderers, killing babies left and right. There even has been some attacks against abortion clinics by some individuals due to this topic. It carries a lot of stigma that other religious beliefs have and is just associated with the \"bible thumping Christians\" which have had quite a few issues.\n\nBut on the other hand, there is the Pro-choice side which greatly disappoints me with how I constantly see them react. I have seen several times the claim that the only reason that abortion is fought against is that these people hate women, that they don\'t want women to have choice and just want them just to make babies and be barefoot in the kitchen. Then there is also just the consistent dehumanization in regards to the Zygote/Fetus/Baby/whatever that absolutely bothers. I understand your reasons to want to choose, but to start justifying it as \"just a clump of cells\", \"merely just allowing the baby to grow outside the womb\", etc. is quite disturbing and seems to try and lighten the fact that abortion is preventing a life that most likely would have been.\n\nBoth sides argue using their own names (Pro-life says the other are anti-life, Pro-choice say the other is anti-choice) rather than actually try and see the other side\'s view. They never seem to address that this is a discussion on a question that has several different factors that all weigh against each other and instead only look at their one point they stand by and say the others are immoral. It really does disappoint me that I see so many people not even try to consider what the other is saying, and then implying intention exactly opposite to the one they claim they say (especially from the pro-choice side in my view, as the other is kind of expected).\n\nI hate this debate because it\'s not even a debate anymore, it\'s just people calling each other horrible names and it just seems like no one can have a nuanced opinion any more.\n\nedit: I have to go to sleep now, sorry.\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

While on the surface this seems like quite a reasonable approach working under the golden rule, treat others as you wish to be treated, thus they treat them as they treat others. While that may be fine it seems to be somewhat a reverse on what tolerance actually is, that despite how you feel, you still treat them kindly, which does not really seemed to be practiced as much.\n\nWhat I am referring to here is stated through a modified Japanese poem on the article\n\n\"The Emperor summons before him Bodhidharma and asks: “Master, I have been tolerant of innumerable gays, lesbians, bisexuals, asexuals, blacks, Hispanics, Asians, transgender people, and Jews. How many Tolerance Points have I earned for my meritorious deeds?”\n\nBodhidharma answers: “None at all”.\n\nThe Emperor, somewhat put out, demands to know why not.\n\nBodhidharma asks: “Well, what do you think of gay people?”\n\nThe Emperor answers: “What do you think I am, some kind of homophobic bigot? Of course I have nothing against gay people!”\n\nAnd Bodhidharma answers: “Thus do you gain no merit by tolerating them!”\"\n\nThis I feel succinctly describes what I find the issue is with this phrase. What is there to gain by tolerating what you already find tolerable? I mean, just based off my own experience, I\'ve never really had any negative feelings or reactions to these listed groups and I figure that quite a few others who espouse the phrase grew up similarly to me. Just because others find these groups intolerable means nothing of how everyone finds these groups. It just seems like a statement of \"I definitely don\'t belong to that group, see how much I like everyone\", one that says how much you tolerate without really even doing much.\n\nIt just seems that the real tolerance these people should attempt is for the people they do find intolerable, the apparent intolerant.\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

Christianity and Islam, by contrast, are very \"high stakes\" religions.  This naturally lends a strong sense of urgency to the actions of their followers.  This is worsened by the notion that the thing you do to be sent to Hell is not believing in the right religion.  This means that your neighbors aren\'t just ignorant, they\'re dangerous, and their ideas can send your loved ones to eternal damnation.\n\n**Manifest destiny**- Many religions have a notion that they\'re only \"for\" people born into them.

Obviously slavery, restricting the rights of other humans, etc. are all wrong. But I do believe that these are unfairly blamed on \"The West\" when in reality \"The West\" was the one to solve it. \n\nFirst is slavery, everyone points to The West as being the main party to blame about slavery. But nearly every civilization owned slaves, Indians owned slaves, Africans owned slaves, the Chinese owned slaves, the Ottomans owned slaves and as we all know Europeans and Americans owned slaves. But it was the West that took the initiative to ban slavery, in 1806 the British ended the slave trade (and slavery in England and Wales itself was never truly allowed as a 1772 court case showed and a 1569 court act foreshadowed) and abolished it empire-wide in 1833. In 1843 it was under East India Company rule that India ended slavery. The importation of slaves into America was banned in 1807 and slavery was finally abolished with the ratification of the 13th amendment in 1865. Other Western countries abolished slavery much earlier. While widely ignored, Pope Paul III banned slavery of the native Americans in 1537. In 1588 Lithuania bans slavery. At this point, credit can also be extended to Japan which formally abolished slavery in 1590 under Toyotomi Hideyoshi. In 1723 Russia bans slavery. In 1761 Portugal abolished slavery. In 1803 Denmark made the slave trade illegal and would outlaw all slavery in Danish-held territory in 1848. In 1793 the French abolished slavery in Haiti. In 1813 Mexico abolished slavery. In 1814 the Dutch abolished the slave trade. And during the 1814-1815 Congress of Vienna, Europe was unified in expressing their desire to abolish slavery. \n\nNow, by 1865 most of the West had abolished slavery. But the rest of the world had yet to catch up. Egypt banned slavery in 1877 after Western (British) prodding and diplomacy finally convinced them. The Ottoman Empire wouldn\'t abolish slavery until 1882. Korea would abolish slavery in 1894 but would continue the practice into the 1930s. China wouldn\'t abolish slavery until 1906. Morocco wouldn\'t abolish slavery until 1922, 1923 for Afghanistan, 1924 in Iraq. Qatar wouldn\'t ban slavery until 1952, 1958 for Bhutan, 1960 for Niger. Saudi Arabia still had legalized slavery until 1962 and the same with Yemen. 1964 is when slavery was abolished in the UAE and 1970 for Oman. \n\nYet for some reason slavery is seen as a mostly exclusive western phenomenon and a mostly western ill. And, with the noted exception of Japan, Europe and The West led the charge to abolish slavery. Contemporary slavery is almost non-existent in the West but still plagues Africa and Asia despite nearly every country in the world now having a law against slavery. \n\nA lot of people today blame The West for not giving enough rights to those who are homosexual, yet it was the West that led the charge to decriminalize same-sex behaviour and bring equality. Today nearly all of The West (with the noted exception of Russia) either supports same-sex equality or doesn\'t actively oppose it (it may not grant marriages but doesn\'t punish it by law). In comparison, homosexuality carries a death sentence in quite a few countries in Africa and the Middle East. Indeed the only African country that allows same sex-couples to marry is South Africa which is perhaps the most westernized of all African countries after a long period of (much demonized) white minority rule. \n\nIn nearly every instance where the west is commonly demonized and claimed to be the source of the problem, it was The West that took the initiative to solve it. That\'s not to say it wasn\'t wrong, but it was almost always the West to realize it was wrong and to take meaningful corrective action. \n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

This is what commonly seems to be the suggested solution for men, under their view that men feel restricted by their roles and a desire to fit with in them. While I may disagree with the importance of such focus (I feel there are more pressing needs and that such a solution wouldn\'t benefit most men necessarily), it\'s still quite a noble goal in theory. However, in practice there doesn\'t really ever seem to be much effort in actually applying it.\n\nTo elaborate, a large aspect of why men seem to be locked into these roles is fear of how others react, and there just seems to be very little effort to actually change how others respond. If men are expected to break their roles to better themselves, others have to begin to accept the roles being broken (especially when what is being asked of men is specifically to open up to others). I mean, look at the civil rights movement, it wasn\'t said that black people just need to do better to better themselves, but that everyone needs to view everyone as equals. It\'s not something that can be done alone, yet I don\'t really see much in ways of even doing so by the people suggesting this solution (and in fact, it seems like the people suggesting such a solution to the problem actually reinforce it with \"Male Tears\" merchandise).\n\nIt just seems like this is not as simple process of \"men show emotions, men do better\" as it just seems to be portrayed, and actual work needs to be done in accepting men who feel such a solution would benefit them. This is a team effort, but it seems that the burden is being put on men to share, but not on everyone else to accept them.\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

This wage gap is more the differences in the overall wages between both sexes and the fact that is largely perpetrated by the fields which men and women go into. Example, We look at the medical profession where women may make less due to a larger amount of women going into nursing, a lower paying job than doctors, with men also being more likely to go into specialized positions, which get payed more for the specialization.\n\nWith that out of the way, I don\'t see how this is an issue at all. I get how it may feel like an issue because surely any discrepancy must mean discrimination, but it\'s quite clear that most of this wage gap is caused by choice in professions. As it seems, men and women seem to have different priorities in the fields they choose to go into and have different things they desire out of it. This can be seen by men typically being the groups to do over time (forgoing time off for more work and pay) or go into more physical strenuous or dirty jobs that pay decently due to being undesirable occupations, while women are more often to go into fields where they get more personal satisfaction and will forgo raises for less work hours or a job closer to their home. Under this, I don\'t see why this is an issue that needs to be solved, especially when the suggested solutions are seemingly to push women towards positions they don\'t apparently wish to occupy.\n\nI understand that the typical response to this is that it\'s gender roles and society that are causing this, but even then, it\'s not really something that seems like an issue. If a woman finds personal satisfaction in a lower paying job, I don\'t see why things need to be changed. The amount of money one needs is a personal matter and it seems that most people are getting by just fine. Additionally, money doesn\'t seem to be much of an issue for women as they are the group that buys the most (and conversely is marketed to the most).\n\nReally, I just don\'t see what the issue is if all the evidence points to the wage gap being personal choice, especially when it\'s a societal wide gap rather than a personal one (the amount of CEO\'s being whatever gender really doesn\'t affect the rest of the populace). \n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

Strongly opposed to having kids, so I don\'t really have a dog in the fight.\n\nSo, my view is specifically in the title, but I want to add a couple of points here so we\'re clear on what my view is:\n\n1. *When financially ~~possible~~ sound.* If losing the other income would make little difference in the child\'s future then I think a parent should stay home.\n\n2. I believe staying at home is ideal because I think it\'s important for a young child\'s development. I\'ve studied the subject as a teacher. Particularly in the formation of language skills, I think it\'s crucial. A ~~mother~~ parent that talks and reads with their child is going to improve the child\'s language skills more than a \"class\" at age 2-4.\n\n3. I believe daycare is an inferior educational medium because I know how frustratingly stupid education systems can be. And I see a lot of daycares where kids just run around and play, which is healthy, but it can\'t effectively teach because the children are spending more time interacting with people on their undeveloped level, and not with a fully developed adult. It\'s just basic math, a 1:1 ratio should be better than 1:10. This is why people pay a private tutor. Plus very young children just aren\'t mentally developed enough for a traditional educational environment, and I don\'t know of a model that could be effective at holding a young child\'s attention without a very high ratio of teachers to students, and that\'s just not economically viable.\n\n**What would change my view**:\n\nBasically I want to know if daycare can beat ~~mom~~ a parent at home. I realize not all ~~moms~~ parents are the same, but neither are all daycares. \n\nAnd I believe, though I would love to know if I\'m wrong, but the most effective daycares are *probably* expensive to the point where ~~mom~~ the parent wouldn\'t have to work anyway. \n\nThat\'s all, I\'m genuinely curious about it because I debate whether national free health care would be good for society or not, so macro-scale arguments matter as well.\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

This means that the average cost of a student with mental disabilities is an additional $9K vs a student that is not mentally disabled ( http://www.nea.org/home/19029.htm ). However, gifted education is typically only a fraction of that, yet is much more beneficial to society. \n\nLet\'s take the benefit to society of a mentally disabled student vs the benefits of gifted education. \n\nLet\'s say we have a student who is mentally disabled, where with special education was applied they would be able to be able to hold a minimum wage job and without that they would be on welfare. Let\'s say that they get $20K a year for 40 years in welfare, that means they cost society $800,000 if they did not have special education and let\'s say that if they did have special education they would not be on any welfare. But, this in and of itself is a miraculous dream for most of the mentally disabled, in reality the chances are that even with special education they\'d still be a drain to society in terms of welfare. \n\nBut, the costs of a gifted student who under-performs is actually much, much, greater for society. Let\'s say that Bill Gates grew up, not to become a computing pioneer, but instead grew up to be a successful used car salesman. The personal computing market is worth billions and the cost of society had Bill Gates (and other computing pioneers) not had access to computers would be billions. \n\nNow, some may argue that gifted students are naturally driven and will succeed no matter what. This may be true, but the difference in terms of societal benefit is huge between a moderately successful gifted person and what they could do if given excellent education. On the other hand, the difference between a wildly successful mentally disabled person (walmart greeter, McDonalds worker) and a non-successful mentally disabled person (living off of welfare) is comparatively tiny. \n\nGood gifted education is also expensive as it requires teachers with higher degrees and specialized equipment (emerging technology is rarely cheap) for the students to use. \n\nI simply don\'t think that it makes sense to fund special education from a broader view, instead that money should be funneled into gifted education where there is a much higher chance for broad rewards to society. \n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

Peterson at the University of Toronto and his refusal to use pronouns he believed are made up and how he believes that a new addition to the Canadian charter would deal with such claims. The controversy section on his wikipedia page seems to be a good summary for any one who is not aware of this conflict.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Peterson\n\nI agree with Peterson in that I don\'t feel that the right to be referred by your preferred pronoun trumps another person\'s right to refuse. My basic reason for this is that I simply find it a matter of respect on whether one person is referred to by their pronoun or not, and by how this tends to occur in other scenarios, the right of someone to insult or belittle someone trumps their right to not be insulted or belittled.\n\nI look at this simply, if someone refuses to call someone a doctor despite having earned the title, it would be rude, but it doesn\'t trump their right to ignore it. Same if someone insults someone by calling them an asshole or a bastard, this right trumps anyone\'s right to not be insulted. \n\nBy calling someone who identifies as a man a woman, you are simply disrespecting their chosen pronoun, it is as much an attack on their identity as calling them an asshole, it is not something more severe that requires stronger protections as pronouns are strictly related in how others refer to you.

You wouldn\'t like it if he took one of your toys without asking, would you?\"\n\nor\n\n\"You shouldn\'t have taken Bobby\'s toy, because you\'re black and he\'s white, and black people shouldn\'t take things from white people!\"\n\nThe first one encourages empathy and consideration for the feelings of others.  The second one is divisive and likely to provoke a strong sense of unfairness.\n\nSo, in summary, even if males are more in need of this education than anyone else, would it not be more effective to apply it to everyone?\n\nI know that it\'s likely that I\'ll be asked for examples of what I\'m talking about, so I offer the [Don\'t Be That Guy](http://www.theviolencestopshere.ca/dbtg.php) campaign.\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

There are basic facts that everyone should know, the basics on how gravity works, basic astronomy, different states of matter, basics of anatomy, etc. but, outside of specialized fields, advanced knowledge of those subjects are unnecessary. Why? Because they can be looked up online. \n\nRather than focusing on memorizing facts, schools should go back to a more \"classical\" method of teaching and focus on the long-forgotten arts of rhetoric and philosophy. And let me clarify, by teaching rhetoric, I do not mean to merely drill into student\'s heads facts about Cicero nor exams asking when Aristotle was born, but actually teaching students how to both use and defend against rhetoric. Similarly, a philosophy class should be discussion on the nature of philosophy, not endless quizzes on philosophers. \n\nTeaching students only facts ends up with them being poorly informed, falling victim to those who have knowledge of rhetoric and who use it against them. Every student needs to know rhetoric and philosophy, on the other hand, not every student needs to know that the mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell. \n\nI would propose, that much like college, students need to start taking classes for what they want to specialize in and be on that \"track\" starting around the middle school/Jr. High time. The time in the student\'s schedule that was mostly filled with classes not pertaining to their chosen track (or their personal interests) would then be substituted with the philosophy/rhetoric classes. Elementary school education would remain roughly unchanged (as there are some facts that everyone needs to know and to appreciate western civilization). \n\nThe current public education system is great for turning out factory workers and janitors, but it fails at developing leadership. \n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

I believe that the work of Project Prevention is overall a good thing, and that even if paid sterilization was done with the worst of intentions, it still wouldn\'t be so bad.\n\nHere are some of the objections that appeared in the thread:\n\nA.  **It\'s racist.**\n\nNo one has presented any evidence that Project Prevention discriminates on the basis of race.  By all appearances, they provide their service to drug addicts, regardless of race.  If minority races happen to have a larger percentage of drug addicts, that is due to factors outside of Project Prevention\'s control.\n\nEven if hypothetically there was an overtly racist agenda behind paid sterilization, I still wouldn\'t see the harm.  If the anti-racist view is that race isn\'t real or doesn\'t matter, then what is lost to the world if a race voluntarily disappears?\n\nIf this sounds cold-hearted, consider that the same logic that objects to it could be used to oppose interracial marriage.  If the races mix enough, then they will no longer exist in their original form.  If the freedom to marry whom we choose trumps any need to preserve one\'s own race, why not the freedom to do what we want with our own bodies?\n\nCulture, by the way, would not necessarily be lost with race.  It can be passed on to adopted children.\n\nB.  **It\'s like the eugenics movement**\n\nThis is pure guilt-by-association fallacy.  The eugenics movement has done horrifying things to people against their will, Project Prevention, as far as I know, has not.\n\nC.  **The clients may change their mind later**\n\nThe hypothetical situation is that an addict will later recover and get their life together and want to become a parent.\n\nWhile I would certainly sympathize with such an individual, we would not be able to function if we weren\'t allowed to make choices we may later regret.  The harm is mitigated due to the existence of adoption.\n\nFrom a utilitarian point of view, I find this potential situation far less troubling than the potential situation of a child born with severe birth defects to a parent who lacks the means and health to take care of them.  I also suspect the latter situation is more likely than the former among the kind of people who would accept $300 to be sterilized.\n\nD.  **They should be focusing on counseling and rehabilitation**\n\nFor some people, that might create a better outcome.  For others, it would not.  It\'s not an either/or decision.  Project Prevention does not, to my knowledge, stop anyone from seeking counseling.\n_____\n\n> *This is a footnote from the CMV moderators. We\'d like to remind you of a couple of things.

Electric, water, gas, internet, and major roadways. Could be an asteroid impact, could be a foreign military invasion, maybe a nuclear war, or hell just a really bad hurricane.\n\nWSHTF assumes that in order to survive, you either have to a) Get the fuck out of dodge (GTFOoD) or b) hunker down in your custom-made bunker.\n\n**Why I believe this**\n\n> Electric cars require electricity which may not be readily available. \n\nConsider the Northeast blackout of 2003. Some people would have had to drive a thousand kilometers to make it to an unaffected area. While ranges are improving, 500kms is about the max these days. And this assumes you have a full charge.\n\nYou could be stranded.\n\n> Electric vehicles are vulnerable as off-road vehicles\n\nOff-road electrics have not been marketed due to range issues I suspect, but even if that\'s resolved you still have the problem of battery packs scraping the ground. If you need to abandon a major road or travel to a more remote location for security, an electric may not get there. \n\n> You can\'t just store more power in a convenient can\n\nA gas can or two allows you to go far beyond your standard range for a minimal cost in weight. Two 20 gallon Jerry Cans get you near a thousand miles of highway driving.\n\n> Self-driving cars are dependent on the internet\n\nSelf-driving cars will eventually use data from other nearby cars, once we reach peak self-driving penetration. While the crucial systems to actually drive the car will be onboard, and probably not connected, there will be a critical link between other cars to manage traffic. Disable this, and you\'ve got some potential gridlock as you try to exit a city. \n\nNavigation is another concern, since you need internet for that, and most people are unable to read a map.\n\n**In conclusion,** if you want to survive the apocalypse or at the very least be able to get to somewhere far away for your safety, a gas-powered vehicle will be more likely to save you. \n\nChange my view please.\n\n_____\n\n> *This is a footnote from the CMV moderators.

The vast majority of them were set in a relatively modern setting rather than where they were they were supposed to be set according to the script.  \n\nTo be clear, I am not talking about original works that were inspired by Shakespeare\'s works, the way that *West Side Story* was inspired by *Romeo and Juliet*.  I\'m talking about performances where the original dialogue is read in more-or-less its original form, but the costumes and sets suggest a different setting.\n\nHere are the reasons why I don\'t think that setting Shakespearean plays in modern-ish settings should be done as often as it is.\n\n* **Any novelty it once had has long worn off.**\n\nThe Onion wrote [an article](http://www.theonion.com/article/unconventional-director-sets-shakespeare-play-in-t-2214) parodying that fact that this has become the norm.  While I can imagine that in the beginning transplanting the plays to alternate setting was a creative way to illustrate the timelessness of Shakespeare\'s understanding of the human condition from a different angle, by this point it would be more novel to see things the audience can relate to in the settings that he wrote about.\n\n* **It\'s patronizing to the audience.**\n\nThe idea that a modern audience can only relate to something if it\'s expressed in terms they can understand is honestly somewhat insulting.  It suggests we lack the imagination and education to relate to people who lead different lives than us.  And it doesn\'t make sense, because in most cases to even follow the plot, the audience has to be at least somewhat educated in the play\'s original context.\n\nI\'m reminded of the scene in Family Guy where Brian is assigned to teach a class of troubled youths, and he attempts to explain *Romeo and Juliet* in terms of East Coast and West Coast rappers, only to receive a bemused reply of, \"That\'s racist, man.\"\n\n* **It gets downright silly at times.**\n\nThe dialogue that Shakespeare wrote is clearly not meant for a modern-ish setting.  Elizabethan English feels jarringly out of place when set in any era past that point.  It becomes particularly jarring when the dialogue refers to things visible to the audience, and the thing is not as the dialogue describes it.  For example, though I can\'t find it at the moment, I remember seeing a clip of a Mafia-ized King Lear (IIRC) calling for his \"longsword\", and receiving an Uzi instead.\n\n* **It doesn\'t always even achieve the goal of making the play relatable.**\n\n*A Midsummer Night\'s Dream* was set in ancient Greece.  In 1999, there was a film adaption set in 19th-century Italy.  I\'ve studied ancient Greece in school, and enjoyed works of fiction adapted from ancient Greek history and mythology.  I know fuck-all about 19th-century Italy.  Setting it closer to modern times makes it less comprehensible and relatable, not more.\n\n* **Trying to make it familiar to the audience can make it less exotic and magical.**\n\nAnother adaption of *A Midsummer Night\'s Dream* I\'ve seen was the one my High School\'s drama department put on, and it sucked me in a great deal just by being set in the original setting.  When I saw Theseus and Hippolyta, instead of seeing a stuffy man in a suit and woman with no memorable features, I was looking at a hero of Greek mythology and a conquered warrior-queen.  I know which one I prefer.\n\nFor these reasons, I believe that more adaptions of Shakespeare should be faithful to the time and place he set them.

Also, realize that any money you would need is going to be asked for before you actually move (you will need bank statements showing that you currently hold X amount of money. Saying that you will work will not cut it). And while COL is expensive, tuition is (often) not a thing (but there will usually be some sort of registration/enrollment fee). As for language courses, I am not sure that would help you look more attractive to companies. You need to realize that many Nordic peoples have almost as strong commands of English than we do, so taking language courses in the US would only help to get you on an even playing field. \n\n2. Depends on the field. As often stated on this sub, STEM fields are often in high-demand.

The countries vary on how long it takes to get citizenship and in Iceland at least, time spent on a student visa doesn\'t count towards your seven years. \n\nIn short, if you\'re serious about this, start saving money and learning the language NOW.

So I bought a 2 week supply off Modup.net in November. I had been a bit curious about Modafinil and was looking to try it out. I\'m a school teacher with other jobs in the evening and simply couldn\'t keep up with certain days. I\'m also working on personal projects, and wanted to get some extra energy to be able to tackle that stuff in my free time. \n\nThe order took about a month to get to Peru. I wasn\'t in a major hurry, but I would have liked it to come a bit faster. Still, it basically did half to go half-way around the world. Packaging was simple but good enough. \n\nSo my first try with it was a full 200mg. I took it with my morning coffee (perhaps overkill) around 6 AM. By 8 I could feel it kicking in, there was definitely something stronger than my coffee in the system. Normally coffee just gets me to baseline, but this time I actually could feel the caffeine. \n\nI was a bit jittery, but I blame that on the coffee. I think the Modvigil just put me at 100% and the coffee made it 120%. By 10 AM I settled down, and was good to go the rest of the day. I worked from 7 to 6 and got home. Normally I\'d be tired, refusing to do any work, and watching a movie before bed. I cleaned my house for 2 hours, scraped away at a pending job, and went to bed at 11. I normally go to bed at 10, but I figured the Modvigil was still there a bit. \n\nI don\'t take it daily. And most days it\'s just 100mg. That\'s exactly what I need to get focused. 200mg is saved for days after a night out or very little sleep. On two recent occasions I had a long night. One for a fever that kept me up, and another up drinking with my buddies. Both mornings I popped 200mg and crushed the day without blinking an eye. Normally I would have been sluggish and barely useful, instead I took down everything on my plate. \n\nI\'ve had no side effects aside from a slightly dry nose and reduced appetite (which I\'m not complaining about). The stuff is great and while I won\'t use it every day it\'s nice to have it handy when you need it. It\'s basically my sidekick now. \n\nThumbs up to Modup.net and the communication too. They were very cool about everything and answered my somewhat impatient emails about the arrival since it was taking a while. \n\nSo 5/5, no complaints here.

For the record, I think it would be best for the local city level of government, but it could be expanded to state legislatures and maybe even the federal level if it worked well enough.\n\nThe core concept is that instead of electing someone into office, we simply draft people into office for a term.

It allows industry experts into areas of public concern. I think it\'s fairly insane for instance that we have politicians deciding health policy and environmental policy when some of them have scarcely a clue as to how those things actually work. \n\n2.

To that I have to say that is that it does matter.\n\nLook, if anything is an issue, and there are people willing to fix it, we should let, them, not say that if they want to fix the issue they have to do something big first. It is nothing but a tactic to stop people from trying to make a change. It does nothing but continue to allow the problem to exist by saying fighting it is not worth it or will do nothing. This is wrong, and kinda scary really. By trying to get rid of people starting small you don’t give them the experience to take on bigger problems or develop the passion to take on something bigger. I mean, even if one only Gamergate supporter moves on to try and tackle bigger issues afterwards, either through passion of solving an issue, or whether it’s another media they are passionate about, it’s still better than none.\n\nThe worst part about this tactic though is that I’m sure many of the people using it are calling themselves feminists, and thus have likely fallen victim to that very same tactic themselves.

I\'m not saying that to make myself look better, just saying that I just don\'t feel that my voice is a necessary addition to everything going on or really feel some actions being taken are necessarily the right way to go about it. Now with that out of the way lets get started.\n\nNow I feel my biggest support for GG has been that society as a whole seems to put a bit too much faith in the media. Sure, people make fun of Fox news all the time and what not, but the other side doesn\'t ever seem to be given that scrutiny. So when a movement comes out that claims to be against media (ignore everything else surrounding the issue for just a moment) and the media is painting that group in a negative light, we should probably start being critical of the media, because even if the opposing side is wrong, the media is on the defensive and would askew any narrative to look better. Yet I\'ve seen several posts about saying that GG is what the media says because the media is all saying it, and that just seems kind of scary. It seems people in general are just accepting without questioning and that shouldn\'t be how it is. I know several people whose opinions I respect (and lots of blog posts looking through the tag on Tumblr) be against GG, and just feel like they really are just following the narrative rather than thinking and then making a decision.\n\nThis shouldn\'t be how it is. It feels like the left has just as much blind spot to their media as the right wing that everyone likes to make fun of. Sometimes you have to do some investigating yourself (and I applaud the people here who do and still disagree) and it just doesn\'t seem like that is happening. Even if GG is wrong (which I don\'t believe it is), it needs to hammer that point in that media is just as biased as yourself and you need to think for yourself, not just align yourself with whatever side seems to be the majority or whatever. There are huge lessons to be had here just by this whole thing existing, and it\'s very important that these lessons get taught, but that unfortunately won\'t happen unless GG succeeds.\n\nSo that\'s why I support GG.

Just if the artist does something you believe to be questionable, do you then ignore their art, or do you still enjoy their art as a separate entity (RL ex. Does Accusations against Bill Cosby not allow you to enjoy his works?).\n\nNow personally, I\'m willing to separate the two. Someone\'s work is a lot different more than their personal life or actions. It includes their passions, their negatives, their positives, and so many other things that it becomes bigger than themselves. Plus, it also helps that I\'ve never cared for the celebrity really, just the product, and if I\'m fine with the product I shouldn\'t feel ashamed for liking for a tangential connection to some other touchy subject (ex. Why should I stop liking a piece of music because the creator murdered someone?). The art stands on it\'s own, and linking the creator to much more than circumstance of creation feels like just a way to discredit the actual work.\n\nI still can see the side of feeling bad for potentially liking someone\'s work if they did something bad, I just don\'t though.

And yes they have been making mistakes, but as far as I can tell they still treat them fairly well (they give out plenty of review copies and about a month before the games come out as well).\n\nSo I figure I\'d just ask how many people here are fans of Nintendo and how you feel they may relate to all of this.

And when a group comes along repeatedly saying you are where you are not because of who you are, but what you are and you have low self esteem, I can\'t see how you wouldn\'t start believing it too the extent they label the issue (I understand where they are coming from, but it\'s severely over estimated). And then I just wonder that if these new people then believe a lot in this they\'ll spread the word to more people with low self esteem, maybe to make them feel like they can solve their guilt by helping out, maybe they don\'t want others to feel good, whatever.

These crimes are all obviously different in their intent and warrant several different punishments as a result. And shouldn\'t it be that way with rape, especially when consent and intent are very important to whether it\'s a crime or not?\n\nNow trying to look up degrees of rape, I don\'t believe I found much that could really apply well to society\'s seemingly more lenient definition of what can constitute rape. So if this is something relatively common that I\'m unaware of I\'m sorry.\n\nAnyways, I figure it could be something like this. 1st degree, basically the serial rapist where the intent to actually have sex uncaring of what the victim thinks. 2nd degree would get a little more complicated, I figure maybe just coming on a bit too forceful for the victim to feel safe in refusing. 3rd would probably be an intoxicated victim/culprit (not to the point of unconsciousness though).\n\nNow I have to ask would be trying to push this be an overall bad thing though? My first thought is that would likely bring a lot of attention as being \"rape apologetic\" and would be even difficult for it to even get any traction. Then there is also how exactly this could affect false accusations, and if it would even affect anything or possibly make it even worse for a falsely accused (due to potential being able to be accused of 1st degree more rather than lower grades).\n\nI\'m sorry if this comes off as ignorant and I\'m just fully unaware of how the court handles rape cases and sentencing, but I feel like having a system like this could potentially help people understand that not all rape is equal.

This would mean that a Male Body with a Man pilot is the natural combination and that there is a biological link between the two concepts.\n\nTrans fits into this scenario by having a swapped pilot. A Women piloting a Male body. While they can get by controlling, they would feel more comfortable back in their matching vehicle (a female body).\n\nMy issues occur with the agender concept however. I mean theoretically I could get the idea of not having a gender, but I just don\'t really get how it works. I mean, how can you know you don\'t associate with either if you have no experience as either? Trans people seem to know who they are without that experience of being in the other vehicle. It just seems like trying to imagine what the lack of existence is, it\'s just impossible. Just really thinking it over it feels like these people are potentially conflating gender roles with genders because I just can\'t really imagine what not relating to a gender is.\n\nThen there is also the idea of being both genders, and again, while theoretically understandable, I just don\'t get how that is supposed to work especially when I see a some people describing as a weird teetering thing that\'s always changing.

While I still have issues, I understand it there because there really isn\'t anyway for someone who isn\'t part of it to necessarily experience it and everyone gets a damn label in the acronym so I\'ll let it pass.\n\nHowever, where I instantly start to despise it is how it seemingly has such a damn negative connotation around it. Allies are good things, not things you grudgingly except exist and dictate specifically how to act, because if they are willing to demean themselves to mere ally, they probably are pretty damn cautious with their words and actions. The term then of course also diminishes the efforts of everyone else, and that\'s honestly kind of disgusting IMO.

Race is pretty similar to the above except the location does change who the groups at the top are so it becomes mostly an issue of Americanization of the topic.

I mean, this is the one group that actively can assist men, but they still get shoved off to the side and referred to as allies in a fight that definitely does affect them, and that\'s just god damn stupid.

Having just watched it, I can say that I\'d recommend it to anyone, but some of these reasons are more specific to the ACS crowd. \n\n1. **You\'ve been hearing about it forever.** It\'s akin to visiting Chicago and having to try their famous pizza. You might not like it, but you can at least decide for yourself if it\'s good or not. It\'s all we\'ve heard about on the podcast for some time, so it makes sense to give it a try. \n\n2. **It\'s a very successful experiment.** For a complex project such as Road Hard to have been funded by Joe Public and Co. is nothing short of a real accomplishment. Say what you will about the ethical boundaries of crowd-funding, the Ace Man took a limited budget and produced a good-looking and well made film. The number of celebrity cameos adds quality to the final product. Road Hard rivals big budget studios at a fraction of the cost, essentially proving a concept. Perhaps we\'ll see more crowd-funded movies in the future thanks to this one. \n\n3. **Video Killed the Radio Star.** A lot of the jokes and situations in Road Hard have already been stated verbatim on the podcast. What Road Hard brings to the table is the additional stimulus of video. Many of the jokes are accompanied with visuals that may re-write the way you had thought of the situation in the first place. Effectively we get to see these situations as Adam experienced them, rather than being tied down to our own inaccurate arbitrary imagined scenes. \n\n4. **It warms your heart.** This was somewhat unexpected, although it shouldn\'t be as The Hammer did virtually the same thing. What I enjoy is how the story chooses to eschew the typical trope of the character reclaiming his former glory. By presenting a very clear defining moment for Adam\'s character, the movie engages us in a profound thought experiment. The warm fuzzy feeling at the end tells us we\'ve made the right choice. \n\n5. **It\'s actually pretty damn funny.** I had to pause a few times to laugh at some of the lines I heard. It does slow down a bit in the second act, but for the most part the laughs are continuous and hard-hitting. I suspect a person who isn\'t a daily listener will find the jokes even better hearing them for the first time. This is a great movie to use to introduce somebody else to AC\'s brand of humor. \n\nOverall I really enjoyed it, and while it\'s not a perfect movie by any means, it does a great job of staying out of its own way. Aside from the opening scene, there isn\'t a of exposition that slows down the pacing. That\'s a good thing. If you haven\'t seen it yet, make it a point to do so.',8,20,0,0,'2yca9m'),(0,1425960976,'geminia999','r/gravityfalls',0,'Honestly kind of meh about this episode','So I\'ve watched Gravity Falls pretty much from when it started and was always interested in a lot of the cipher stuff.

And considering that not much else has really become more hinted at I kind of lost interest in everything but the ciphers really.\n\nBut now we finally get something concrete and it\'s one thing that seemingly has nothing to do with the overall mystery really. It\'s a sci-fi thing that doesn\'t really explain much besides stan\'s actions and the author with it being confirmed. The Machine seems to be a star gate of some kind and that whole idea of being in another universe/galaxy doesn\'t really mesh well with the super natural aspect much.\n\nIt also probably didn\'t help that we know that time travel exists and that kind of just ruined things a bit more with the sci fi aspect rather than the super natural.\n\nI don\'t know, I\'ll probably look more fondly on this episode as more of the story is developed, but this just seems kind of bland after we just had Bill teased and I\'m just more interested in all of that then this stuff.

The thing is that I kind of disagree with both concepts really.\n\nWhat I mean by this is that obviously shoving minorities in to fill quotas isn\'t right, but I also have issues with the idea of making every character who is a minority have that be so crucial to their character arcs. I mean most minority struggles are due to the fact that they are minorities in society (outside of ones that are due to disability or trans) and while those stories focussing are important, being the only story that can really do these people justice seems to potentially make things worse.\n\nBy having stories constantly focusing on how these people don\'t fit in and their troubles are because of that, focusing on what makes us different rather than how they are the same.

Some history first: \nI (an American) moved to Peru in 2009 when I was still quite young. I had no connections to the country at all. I had had two girlfriends in my time in the states, and for much of my life had been overweight and extremely unexposed to women. I had zero game. \n\nWhen in Peru I found that I was instantly higher on the SMV charts because I was American, and white. Girls automatically looked to me as a better option both physically, and mentally, figuring that I had money to provide for them. I quickly realized this would be awesome, and have proceeded to plow my way through the country. \n\nOne thing I have noticed though is how the women here pour on the affection. They make themselves appear to be wholly and only devoted to you. They\'ll clean your house the morning after blowing you. They\'ll be sweet and cute and make you feel special. And they\'re always interested in your (perceived) money. I had none, so it was more noticeable to me. For most American men, this means being treated like a king. I met a girl within my first week here, and stayed with her for 5 months. \n\nThat changed as time went on. Her act wore down when she saw I wasn\'t interested in a full blown committed relationship. I wanted to fuck everything that moved. The sweet cuddly girl who did everything for me became a nuisance. \n\nGetting closer to the point, I\'ve met a large number of foreigners here who have come down and experienced the same immediate response from the women here. They, like me, are showered with attention and praise for perhaps the first time. But I cannot tell you how many men I know who have come down here, and married the first chick that fucked them. Unattractive hags who immediately start bearing children. They lock their betas down so fast it\'s incredible. \n\nWhen I first saw this in action, I couldn\'t really comprehend it. In my mind I would think: \"Dude, you\'re white, in Peru, you\'re American/European/Whatever. Why aren\'t you out getting laid all the time by random hot chicks?\" \n\nI noticed patterns, but I never made the connection. Then I found TRP. It all makes sense now. Peruvian women are more intense than American ones. They take the usual shit tests and double them down. They force men to be more affectionate and soft, else they guilt them by saying \"you don\'t love me\" or \"I don\'t think we should have sex because you don\'t care about me.\". I\'ve been on the end of these shit tests dozens of times. \n\nThese women are hamsters on steroids. They will slut it up to hell and back, but every one of them will claim they \"never do this,\" or that \"It\'s been years.\" All of them are opportunistic sluts, and they\'re better at it. The gap between rich and poor is astonishing here. Thus, the need for women to rise out of the ashes is greater. The payoff is huger. \n\nThus, this increased intensity separates Blue Pillers from Red Pillers even faster, and clearly defines them. Every one of those BP guys I\'ve met is deep down miserable with their marriages. Yet they\'re convinced and repeatedly say \"I love my wife, she\'s such a great mother, she\'s my everything.\" They\'ve had it beaten into them. Once the babies came out, the sex goes. Then the bitching and moaning. These women refuse to work most of the time, and love spending money. They will suck the life out of a beta, and bleed him dry, with the goal of eventually getting to the US. \n\nTRP has solidified my resolve to avoid their fate by going in a different direction.

I\'ve always considered myself a liberal (I do not anymore because I would just rather have my opinions not be tied to a label that may misrepresent them) and followed some left leaning people. But over discovering this stuff I\'ve just felt afraid to try and really express myself for fear of large backlash. I\'ve been blocked by those I followed for saying women didn\'t owe feminism, and I\'ve gotten into some intense discussions with my brother on the topics. I fear bringing up my opinion up at my school because I really do not know how I will be viewed because the reaction could vary from meh to outright and instant disdain.\n\nI fear speaking up because it seems anyone that doesn\'t fit in within the exact line will get attacked and not be allowed to defend themselves.

And while you may think it is just semantics, it really does bring a whole wealth of implications with it. To start it is a discussion that is framed at the people who have privilege as opposed to the ones who do not. By using the word privilege instead of something like societal bias/disadvantages or even just discrimination to address the problem the focus isn\'t on those who actually are hurt. It focuses on all the \"benefits\" others have instead of focussing on anything that will actually solve anything.\n\nNow I understand that privilege is not the only approach here to solving problems, but it seems a bit too prevalant a discussion point. Specifically the \"check your privilege\" variant of how it is often discussed. The suggested path is that you see how advantaged you are to others to see where there struggles come from. But I have some issues with this. The first again, it\'s a question that puts you at the fore front, not the victims. You end up asking what you have, versus what others do not. While it is okay to look at that every once in a while, it is a very negative outlook really. Then there is the kind of common complaint of what do you do after you check your privilege. And I understand the \"let others have a voice\" line, but that seemingly often leads to asking you to silence your own in exchange, which is something I personally do not like. There is also the fact of the matter that me checking my privilege doesn\'t really change how I treat anyone. I already try to be considerate to others and to not discriminate (I\'ve personally grown up in a area that is openly accepting and I was afraid to say someone was black because I felt that defining others by appearance like that was racist), I can emphasise with someone in a worse situation and I\'m sure most people can (otherwise trying to get donations through guilt wouldn\'t work). I don\'t really get anything from checking my privilege besides a sense that what I may have is undeserved.\n\nAnd this is a huge part of my issue with privilege, from what I\'ve witnessed we as a society do not generally like privileged people. It seems that the privileged are viewed as people who have undeservedly gotten benefits from society and typically treated better because of it. We view them negatively and generally would wish not to be considered as such (much like how no one would consider themselves a badguy). But within this discussion, we are really calling \"not being treated badly\" privilege and I have huge issues coming at it from that angel above. When we phrase privilege in such a sense, we want to not be privelleged because that\'s generally how people work. People are going to convince themselves they aren\'t this horrible thing because people generally don\'t want to view themselves negatively. This seemingly results in a denial that they have privilege, which then focuses the argument away from actually trying to help people who may need it into what privilege is, or try to find justifications for how they aren\'t actually in these privileged groups. There is also acceptance, but that usually leads to a form of self hatred for those aspects that are privieleged because accepting privileged is basically accepting that what you have is undeserved and that not being treated badly is a thing that makes you worse off. It just is something that has no real winners for me as each of these outcomes do not actually help anyone and just generally make people feel worse about themselves for things they can\'t control (this is coming from not only personal experience but some other tales I\'ve heard, it seems more common an interpretation than I fear people may believe).\n\nWorking off the idea of privileged generally being a bad thing, it sets the bar for treating others low rather than high. Again, a privilege is undeserved, so not being treated badly is a privilege and should not be had. This suggests to me from that same interpretation that the solution is bring the privileged out of privilege, which would then be treat everyone like shit. Now that\'s not something I really like. I\'d rather bring people up and treat them nicely (which I do). And while I know some would say \"obviously we bring people to the privileged levels\" it doesn\'t seem so obvious to me. My mind goes more towards \"kill the bougerousie\" in the way to solve the issue of \"privileged people\" and I feel that is not an uncommon understanding considering we don\'t like privileged people.\n\nThere is also the fact that privilege is very much a social wide observation. It just seems to really melt down when we get to the individual level as each is unique and will meet people who follow and don\'t follow those societal trends. This also then bleeds into again the personal inspection of privilege, where now we are checking ourselves on a system that is bigger than us and is going to just lead to bad results.\n\nLastly, there really isn\'t much distinction between different levels of privilege. What I mean by this is that a privilege a white person would have over a black person would be seemingly lighter sentencing overall, but a privilege of a male over female is not being called bossy. These things aren\'t really comparable to any degree, yet both are considered privileges. And this muddies the discussion quite a bit because either it\'s at the very extreme ends where there are major issues that are actively hurting people, versus opinions about a demographic that may or may not affect how you decide to choose a career path. These things really shouldn\'t be intermingeled so easily, but they are quite a bit and it just creates feelings that extreme ends aren\'t as extreme by lumping with the low end stuff, or that the low end stuff is equal to the extreme stuff. This is one topic I\'ve only recently considered about the topic, but I feel it is a very important distinction that we really need to start making if this is the approach we are going to continue down.\n\nTL:DR: I feel that using the term privilege overall puts burden on those that have it as opposed to actually focussing on the issues that need improving. This also has a negative affect as we don\'t want to view ourselves as privileged, thus we either start denying it exists (to good and bad extents), deny that you have it yourself, or swallow the bullet and start disliking yourself (from personal experience and other stories). This also makes us think that the privileged state of not being treated badly is wrong rather than look to just bring others up.\n\nSo that\'s pretty much my collective thoughts on the privilege discussion, so I open up others to share their thoughts, agree, disagree, or just post examples you feel are relevant.',30,473,0,0,'33sdii'),(5,1430082504,'geminia999','r/TiADiscussion',0,'Question about Trans statistics','So, I\'ve been a bit too negative and cynical recently, so everytime I hear how often a trans person is to fear being assaulted/murdered for being trans it seems somewhat fishy (along with potential suicide statistics but those sound more believable in general).

There are also incidents such as the HBB where their ideas where seemingly censored for not agreeing (as the expo will not elaborate it can only be assumed based off the evidence we have and what they have previously claimed). There is also issues with the block bots that are often used by people on the other side, and while I don\'t think many would actually call them censorship, they disagree with the principle of attaching people to a list that has been conflated as a list of harassers. That each block typically if it were to happen should be made individually so as to not create a bubble where only your view is seen and avoid blocking several relatively innocent people.\n\nOn the other side, they seem likely to agree that these incidents of change are not censorship, it is merely listening to their audience and changing. There will typically be a feeling that intent behind anything does not typically matter if it can be read in a harmful way. They will typically believe that self censorship is rarely a thing and that it\'s just convincing the artist and thus can not be censorship as it was change under their own volition. The scenario with the block bot seems to be under the idea of \"no one has to listen to anyone\" and thus a mass blocking of people they typically would not wish to listen to is acceptable.\n\nI think that about does it. Do you feel that there is an apparent \"censorship\" present coming from the \"left\" and/or that there is reason to be potentially worried?\n\nAs for myself, I will say saying censorship is possibly an over exageration (except for the case of HBB as CalExpo has done nothing to try and explain why it is not after evidence has surfaced), but that I agree that maybe people should stop asking so much for changes to be made as if a precedence for it does happen (and some will say there already is) that it could end up leading  to situations where this occurs often and thus not agreeing to change would cause very negative backlash.

On none of those occasions have I lost anything important. \n\nAvoid a demoralizing, frustrating experience by following these simple maxims:\n\n1. Data you don\'t have three copies of is data you don\'t care about.\n\n2. Backing up files is not a choice, it\'s a requirement for success. \n\n3. An outdated backup is a useless backup. \n\nSo to address the first point, **how should you backup your files?** \n\nHaving three copies does you no good if they are on the same device. You need one copy on three separate devices in order to be properly backed up. Your copies should be as follows:\n\n1. Working local copy. This is stored on your local machine (drive C:), in whatever folder you prefer. This is the file you first created when you first pressed save. You should only do work on this file. \n\n2. Cloud Copy. You save this to an online cloud service (more on this in a bit). You never work on this copy. It is stored somewhere far far away, in a magical place that you will never see. Your house could burn down, and it will still be there. \n\n3. Secondary local copy. This is saved on an external hard drive kept in your home. If you\'ve suffered a PC problem, and your internet connection is not working, this ensures you have access to your backup. \n\nClear? The key to good backups is having a plan B, and a Plan C. Should your house burn down (happened to me) you\'ll still have the cloud to save you. Should you get hacked and lose access to your online data and/or PC, you have a secondary local backup to save you. Effectively you are safe in almost every situation sans nuclear holocaust, in which case you probably shouldn\'t be worrying about your precious unfinished novel draft. \n\nSo now, **what should you use to backup your files?**\n\nEveryone has a working local copy. What we need are cloud copies and a secondary local copy. \n\nFor the former, I recommend [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/download/) and [Onedrive](https://onedrive.live.com/about/en-us/) by Microsoft. I support these two because they are run by well established, highly reputable companies whose failure rate so far is basically zero. \n\nDownload their software, and you will see this in your Windows Explorer: [Link to screenshot](http://imgur.com/6pYROjf.png)\n\nNotice how now it populates the sidebar, as if it were another folder on your computer (it\'s not). This makes it super easy to use. \n\nYou can click on it, and browse just like any other folder on your PC. [Onedrive when opened](http://i.imgur.com/KoWayQy.png)\n\nYou can see I have a lot of important files in here, such as \"Crap to Do\" and my most important folder \"My writin\" is also present. \n\nSimply drag the file you wish to make a backup of, or the entire folder if you so desire, into the Onedrive or Google Drive window and voila! You\'ve backed up to the cloud. It will use your internet connection to transfer the files in the background.\n\nSo what about your secondary local copy? You need an external hard drive. These are cheap. [Here\'s a good one.](http://www.amazon.com/Passport-Ultra-Portable-External-Drive/dp/B00E83X9P8/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1430609572&sr=8-1&keywords=1tb+external) That\'s about $60 for enough space to copy your entire computer, and it\'s portable. \n\nWhen I go to My Computer, I see [this.](http://i.imgur.com/96ie73L.png)\n\nJust like I do with Onedrive or Google Drive, I copy the entire folder into the external hard drive. All you have to do is plug it in and it\'ll work. I\'ve renamed it to be more obvious since as you can see I have a bunch of storage (and I unplugged my 4tb external just to simply matters for this guide). \n\nSo, when I open that, I see [this.](http://i.imgur.com/jwqauDc.png) Again, \"My writin\" is preserved in three separate locations. \n\n**When should I backup my files?** \n\nEvery time you finish working on your project, copy it to the two separate destinations. Why when you finish? Because then if something horrible happens overnight, such as a crackhead breaking into your home and stealing your computer, you won\'t miss a single word. If you backup before, you miss the day\'s work. \n\nDiscipline yourself! Form a habit. You are not done writing until you have backed up your files. So do not open that wine just yet! Once you\'ve made your two copies, feel free to whiskey yourself into oblivion, and rest assured knowing that you have multiple backups to prevent any potential loss.\n\n*A couple of side notes*\n\nUSB thumbdrives are not backups. These suck ass. They are only for the transferring of files from one place to another. Never, ever, rely on them for long-term storage and never work on them. \n\nBurning a CD/DVD for backups is a waste of time nowadays with affordable external hard drives. Plus they\'re not very useful for items that are going to be changed (like your latest movie script about a victimized dolphin who becomes a man, gets a job at Sea World, and rapes other dolphins as a human).\n\nDon\'t backup via email. It\'s not only slow, it\'s cumbersome. You have to find the exact email again and re-download the file, putting it in a different place on your machine than where it first was. Then you have a bunch of emails with the same file only with different dates. If you must keep different versions, simply rename the file before you back it up. \n\nIn case you were wondering (you weren\'t) what I do for backups, I have both Google Drive and Onedrive, two hard drives inside my computer (in case one fails), and two external drives. I leave one external drive at a friend\'s house. Yes, I am extremely paranoid about backups. \n\nQuestions?

There\'s only one group of beings that I just really dislike as a whole, and it\'s exclusively the Chinese. No, not the Koreans, not the Japanese, not anyone else on the planet - just the Chinese. Only. There are just so many things that I don\'t like about them; the way they look, their language (read: their noise), their little mannerisms, etc... and I just feel like they don\'t have emotions like the rest of us. If you observe them, it\'s as if they don\'t think and feel like the rest of us. All around, I just see them as a great ugliness in the world. They\'re like aliens or robots. It brings this really unsettling anxiety over me to think that these... people outnumber the rest of us and could possibly become a world power. I know that it\'s not socially acceptable to think things like this, but honestly, if I had things my way, China would cease to exist (or at least be brought down to a population that\'s less than the rest of us). \n\nThis is different, because I don\'t feel like my racism is born of ignorance. In my World History class we studied the ancient Chinese culture and history extensively because it was my teacher\'s favorite topic, in my IB History class we studied communist China with Mao, and in my Humanities class we did a unit on Chinese mythology, art, technology, etc... (which was pretty cool), yet I still, just can\'t bring myself to like the Chinese or even see them like the rest of us even though I thoroughly enjoyed learning in these classes. \n\nYou wouldn\'t know I was a racist, and I don\'t go around treating people differently - there\'s no reason to do so and it would be socially devastating. Rather, it\'s all in my mind and I just think about it whenever the Chinese are brought up or near. I\'ve known Hmong people and I\'ve never had a problem or thought badly about them, and I\'ve known Koreans and I love K-Pop, so it\'s not like I just hate Asians, because I don\'t.

It suggests that by having people display themselves in a manner that displays physically attractive characteristics that it puts focus on that aspect solely. When people view others like this it suggests that people stop seeing these displayed people as individuals but rather objects by focusing on the visually appealing aspects they display. I know this is likely a simplification of the topic, but I still feel it captures the base theory behind it (though the logic connecting it all together is probably a bit more thought out).\n\nNow for the main arguments I hear against using this terminology is that it\'s a misrepresentation and shaming of sexuality. That not only does it take away the agency of the people who are \"objectified\" (they are workers choosing to display themselves because they want to, it\'s their choice and thus can\'t be objects because they are acting), but that it inherently misunderstands that being attracted to a body is an inherently negative and wrong thing (by implying that viewing people in that manner means you stop viewing them as a person at all). It seems to ignore that you can look at attractive people appreciating their attractiveness and acknowledge that they are people as well. I\'ll admit again that this is a short summary since it\'s not much a topic I\'ve really cared to look into and seems to come somewhat from a same frame as privilege, where the term used to describe the scenario has a connotation that an average person would attach to it that one who would study using these terminologies has divorced themselves from.\n\nNow there is one argument against saying objectification is a thing to worry about and it\'s the one that got me to actually come and start this topic. I heard this during a Honey Badger Brigade podcast (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfJBBkITaQ It starts about 54 minutes in and goes to about an hour and three minutes if you want to hear how she puts it) and it really resonated with me. Basically, they phrase their dislike in that humans are very much a species that applies motivations and actions behind several things that could not even have them (such as the weather). We tend to do the exact opposite of objectification and instead personify objects. To say that people objectify others is to suggest that this whole scenario causes humans to abandon their nature (in a scenario which is extremely natural) and that it could really be somewhat of a condition like sociopathy (no empathy), just the failure to have an inherent function of the brain when having an absolutely normal response.\n\nSo now that I\'ve given my summary, I will ask, do you agree that objectification is truly an issue or even a thing?

My question though is what exactly is up with the rest of the species in the world in their relation.\n\nFrom the lands of where all the other characters come from, it seems likely that humans are likely living all over the world and have been doing so for quite a while. They seem to worship the \"gods\" (as they are called gods) and there are quite a few more than just the 4 who got the lord souls and their children (heck, they seem basically restricted to relation to gwyn since the witches seem to stay at Izalith and Nito just bounced out of there).\n\nSo we have a basic hierarchy, which I can only presume exists because humans came into existence after the other species seemingly, but it still just kind of seems a bit odd. And one of these oddities is that humans seem almost identical to some of these other races (the witches of Izalith aren\'t human, and gwyn and gwyndolin are just slightly taller than the main character (and then gwynevere is seemingly an actual giant?).

Instead of going the usual extreme route of power+prejudice (though it\'s in there a bit), it\'s more along the lines of anything that could be considered sexist somewhat gets hit by the label.\n\nThis is just seemingly another issue I have with all these discussions because it always feel like the social justice side never seems to wish to give up their definitions and accept that they are a minority in using the definitions, instead using words with so much power behind them for seemingly minor examples.

Any match I win I\'ll get about 1100 at max, 400 at worst and that just makes grinding really annoying. I mean, just trying to reach for level 10 before ranked launched was a lot for me.

That\'s simply not in place as you can\'t really get more points in this game without letting the opponent cover more (so you can cover it again) so you always get about the same amount of points for each round (favoring rollers for the points and disadvantaging chargers).

In practice though, it takes way too long for the stages to switch, causing stagnation there after an hour or two, where you then have to wait another 2 hours before you can experience new stages (unless you want to risk the no gain of rank). Then there is also the fact that whenever I play, it seems to get into a groove of repeating the same stage over and over and never actually alternates (or if it doesn\'t it\'ll be for one match then go back).

I suppose it\'s mostly turf wars that I figure the discussion is open to, but feel free to add ranked mode as well.\n\nNow, my favourite stage right now Arowana Mall. There is just something about it\'s design that opens it the best to even play. The two platforms before the center give lots of room to breath around for fights making those really nice areas where fair battles can go on. Than there are the side paths that give vantage but just about that, it works really nice and the way they are designed it\'s possible to get around the enemy and campers easily as well. Then of course there is the raised center. This is probably the most violent part of the stage, where it constantly changes. It is much smaller than the rest, is uneven, and has the ability to fall off into the water. It\'s quite great for a center of a map as it allows itself to be a point where you can mount a defense, but also it\'s a defense that can be passed and broken easily. This basically causes lots of back and forths that are great. But I think my favourite part is the path from the center platform into the enemy territory. It\'s a relatively safe passage if you can get there and that allows you to ink behind forcing the enemy to go on the defensive and it\'s just fun. It also works pretty well for all weapon types and sub weapons which just adds to all this.\n\nAs for my least favourite, it\'s probably Urchin Underpass. I don\'t know, it\'s just boring and has a bit too many unpaintable surfaces. It just kind of gets annoying and the main point just isn\'t really well designed. You can\'t really utilize the jumps so you have to go around the sides and that just really makes it just a bore for me and too easy for one team to push out where all the defensive can do is try and push them back rather than get behind them.',6,8,0,0,'38mo3o'),(99,1433520871,'kingofthefeminists','r/TumblrInAction',0,'(TW: not tumblr) We expected engineers and schoolteachers to have the same starting salary because both required a piece of paper from a university','',13,54,0,0,'38ooju'),(1,1433553356,'geminia999','r/splatoon',0,'I really dislike Urchin Underpass','This map is just really annoying to play on, and that\'s quite a disappointment considering it\'s kind of the games standard map (what they typically showed off during E3 and trailers). It\'s just a map that just doesn\'t really work out all that well in practice.\n\nMy main point of dislike is that there isn\'t really any easy way to get around the main pit area. You can either just try and make a dash towards the one ground entrance on the opponent\'s side or try and kill everyone before which just doesn\'t work out well. Then there is also the one side way which is just way too difficult to get to, and considering it\'s the only one, is also quite crowded and thus hard to use for sneaking around. This basically forces conflict in the center and I have huge issues there as well.\n\nThis center pit is quite possibly my least favourite meet up in the game and it\'s just not fun to work around. The pit in the center is  really what does it though. It\'s just a bit too wide for it to be practically jumped meaning you pretty much have to walk around and that just causes so much direct conflicts. And while this can be good, it feels like one of the only maps that has it\'s ending pretty dependent on the fact of how well you can kill the opposing team rather than just inking the ground.\n\nThen even after you can manage to get pass the ink bath, the part after the fact is just really a mess to get around, it\'s just not really designed for people to push it. And while that is good as it can prevent huge pushes, it\'s still quite annoying because of just how deadly the center is and the difficulty in getting there. You\'re at low ground so anyone you killed trying to get there has a very huge advantage considering it\'s not too tall that the distance the shots travel are that long. Then it\'s kind of a mess trying to get around making it just an annoyance to even try and backdoor it.\n\nI just really don\'t see what this map does well as it feels like anything it could have going for it is done better in other maps leading to map that doesn\'t really have an advantages to it and lots of negatives as well.

Porn is your right, and it keeps women working for you.**\n\nI\'m a frequent watcher of Ted Talks. I find many of them remarkably interesting and educational. However, when they touch on social issues, they tend to be so BP I can\'t even watch.\n\nWhile browsing some of the options for the TedX channel on Youtube, I saw there were several playlists of 10 videos each on specific subjects. Sex was one of the categories, so I flipped over to the playlist.\n\nFour of the titles were about porn, and they were as follows:\n\n* Make Love, not Porn (by a woman)\n* Why I stopped watching porn (by a man)\n* It\'s time for Porn to Change (by a woman)\n* Feminist Porn, Shifting our Sexual Culture (by a woman)\n\nI point out the gender of the speaker because I find it relevant. Two of these videos are about changing porn itself, strictly from the woman\'s perspective, which is obviously because men don\'t see a problem with porn as it is (and why should they?).\n\nThe other woman-led talk focused on not watching porn and making sex more intimate. Obviously this fits the feminist agenda quite well.\n\nIt\'s the final one that gets me. A man making a case for why he stopped watching porn. There\'s more blue in this than there is in the fucking sky. I actually watched this one, and here are some highlights.\n\nHis 2nd reason for not watching porn is that he considered it contributing to \"filmed prostitution.\" Give him credit where it\'s due, he calls it exactly what it is. But he goes the wrong direction after:\n\n> Prostitution was nobody\'s childhood dream, it is always the result of trouble and distress. \n\nBy equating porn with prostitution, he\'s able to make this ridiculous leap in logic. Nevermind that a woman can make a ridiculous quantity of money doing porn or whoring herself out on a webcam. Nevermind that nobody is forced to do it in the developed world. Nevermind that many girls raised in decent family situations and in good standing in society choose to do this to reap those financial benefits before hitting the wall. Nope, porn = girl in trouble. White Knight if I ever heard one.\n\nHe goes on to say that \"porn is all about male domination of women. Subordinance of women.\" Nevermind that this is what women actually prefer in bed.\n\n> What qualifies something as sexual? Whatever men find arousing. Men find it amusing to choke a woman, to have brutal sex without one touch, hug or kiss, a tender caress.\n\nHe goes on to rattle off some categories of porn which are demeaning to women, such as crying or abuse or rape porn. Granted, I feel like those categories are out of the question for me. But he conveniently omits the fact that almost every major porn site has \"for women\" categories. He also ignores the fact that women can and do enjoy porn, too. \n\n> [5. About 1 in 5 women \\(18%\\) use the Internet for sexual purposes habitually—every week.](http://www.covenanteyes.com/2013/08/30/women-addicted-to-porn-stats/) \n\nI bring this up because I think porn doesn\'t get a big discussion on TRP. Obviously life is better when the sex is real, porn shouldn\'t be your life, and addiction to anything is bad. But in my opinion, porn satisfies a male need, one that women are currently failing to satisfy. Few people are watching regular good ole\' fashioned missionary sex porn, because many people can get that.\n\nPorn provides something that most people aren\'t able to experience on a regular basis. And that very fact irritates women. Why should women want to have higher expectations for them in bed? Starfishing the night away is much easier than performing oral, taking a cumshot on the tits, and actually moving her ass while riding your cock reverse cowgirl. Porn sets the bar for men, and women don\'t want to jump over it. \n\nLast point:\n\n> Girls get this notion that if you want to be worthy of love, you have to be worthy of sexual desire.\n\nAgain, nailed it on the head, except he presents it as a tragedy. Yes women, the whole reason we get married, the whole reason we talk to you, the whole reason we enjoy your company (or pretend to), is for sex. And it\'s for that reason that there are millions of unattractive women in the world, grotesque, hideous beasts, who go unsexed and unwed for their entire lives. \n\nPorn reduces our need for sex, and thus reduces our need for women. Therefore porn is directly against women\'s best interests. It\'s no wonder that they attack it. Don\'t be like this tool and cave in on the issue. If she doesn\'t want porn, she can satisfy you like a porn star. \n\n',19,99,0,0,'38rhde'),(1,1433620862,'MultiAli2','r/anonymous',1,'Anonymous, please help Kansas!','[removed]',2,3,0,0,'38twry'),(1,1433621193,'braininajar8','r/circlejerk',0,'/╲/\\╭(ఠ్ఠఠ్ఠ˓̭ ఠ్ఠఠ్ఠ)╮/\\╱\\ you made spider sad,upboat so he is happy.','[removed]',0,0,0,0,'38txit'),(2,1433642990,'braininajar8','r/amishadowbanned',0,'am i banned?','i have been naughty',1,2,0,0,'38v3f1'),(3,1433643178,'Impacatus','r/lisp',0,'Which implementation should I use for CGI server-side development?','As long as I\'ve been web developing, it\'s embarrassing that I\'ve only recently learned about CGI.

I mean, it\'s in space, that\'s pretty damn separate from everything else in the game, and if we assume Dark Souls is on a Planet, must have existed since before it even formed likely. So how does the sun then fit into the grey lands?\n\nNow since I posed that question, I have a little theory considering one of the concept arts shown for DS3, and that\'s the sun is the source of the first flame. My theory is that it is likely like a drop of energy/plasma from the sun the fell onto this land and brought life to the things around it. My reason for believing this (outside of giving a reason for how the heck it just started in the first place), is that one of the concept arts shows the sun leaking. It\'s quite the striking image and brings a lot of ideas to it. And if the sun is the source of the first flame, it\'s the source of all the souls it brought (including the death and Dark Soul), so considering the darkness leaking out of the sun, it seems quite like possibly the true coming of the age of dark (as I always wondered how the age of dark would work in correlation to the fact there is a giant sun shining light down, and if it\'s linked to the flame it would explain how it would be dealt with). So with that in mind, it would seem like DS3 would be set in breaking the cycles elaborated on in 2 and bring either destruction or continuation of the world in a way free of the cycles and the flame/sun.\n\nI know it\'s way too early, but it\'s always been something that seems just odd about the world itself to have a sun, but also a giant ass flame that apparently will cause darkness if it goes out.

(On my CV I can still list that I worked through this period, since I will be working 2-3 days/month at a place where I\'ve worked for the past 3 months… so I\'ll avoid the appearance of a big employment gap.)\n\nSorry.

Just something to point out that this doesn\'t have to happen? This is a moment when children are rightly seeing the harm their actions are causing; they\'re contemplating abusing the trust and love that their animal placed in them, and many of them are seeing it as wrong. Simply being there and identifying as a vegan will get into many of those kids\' heads at that moment, before they have a chance to rationalize it away again, and accept the rationalizations of their family or their society.\n\nI think that kind-hearted vegans would get a lot of mileage out of going to events where FFA or 4H students are about to sell off the animals they\'ve raised lovingly for a year. No arguments, no shouting, just \"it\'s sad, isn\'t it? I\'m glad I stopped eating animals.\" Or \"I\'m glad I\'m healthy without eating meat.\" If a kid is interested, give them a handout. It doesn\'t have to be a shocking bloody one, either; remember, most of them already recognize the wrong being done.

So I figured it might be a nice idea to discuss the three modes and say which is your favourite and which is your least.\n\nNow my personal favourite is probably Splat zones. Not only does it keep the core concept of turf wars of painting ground as opposed to necessarily killing, it\'s the one mode where the leading team basically must be on the defensive as opposed to the others where you still try to reach the goal. Then there is also the dual splatzone maps which work really well in splitting up the team and make sure that the better team is actually able to have a strong push to cover two zones and then defend them. Then add that it typically seems to be the most varied mode depending on which map is being played it definitely is probably my favourite.\n\nMy least favourite is TC hands down. It\'s just feels really cheap at times and I just can\'t stand it at times. Sometimes it\'s really damn easy to hold a defence and prevent the tower from going anywhere while the offence has to deal with not only fighting the map but pushing an incredibly slow and pathed object. The mode also feels like the one that can be abused the most by special spamming due to again a lot of concentration on the tower (offensive ones can basically take out the tower entirely while defensive ones can make tryign to take it back a nightmare, and add that all together at one once and it\'s just a clusterfuck. Also teammates don\'t help much either :/\n\nAs for Rainmaker, I like it quite a lot since it\'s basically an all improved version of TC. You can get a multitude of paths going instead of the one, the rainmaker itself isn\'t all that great a weapon meaning it does have to be supported, but also can have an individual do some pretty neat stuff instead of \"hide behind tower\".

Now this is a very surface level reading and I\'m curious about others views on the subject.\n\nAdditionally, I bring this up because there is at least one factor I wish to discuss among this. This scenario is going to ignore the journalistic ethics side of things for a second. I personally believe that ZQ is an emotional abuser as proved by Eron\'s evidence. I see people defending an abuser and further harming a victim of abuse because they feel a witch hunt is happening against her. That her crimes are lesser than that of the people calling her crimes out and thus those people are worse than the abuser (I\'ll have it known I have ever had contact with ZQ once, where she approached me through PM after reading one of my comments). These are apparently the people who will support stuff like donglegate in where they do the exact thing, but in this case the crime there is a crude joke that was overheard. It feels to me that in a lot of these cases, it is truly the opposing side that is using such tactics frivolously and for minor cases, while ones associated with GG are for somewhat more morally right reasons and thus more justified. It is here I will clarify that I have not participated in any of these and that any threats associated go too far and that some are a bit unjustified as well (such as Wu, but I honestly don\'t know if she necessarily even has one against her).\n\nSo is the mere association of witch hunts with both sides and the disapproval by both sides hypocritical, or is such techniques used for more moral causes and are thus justified in some sense over the other side\'s use?

They were about general how they played in comparisons to similar games, technical issues, or some cool looking art. They seemingly were designed on a level of saying whether or not the product met a standard and how it related to it. This is a system that seemingly benefits consumers who wish to be conservative on what they buy, and wish to buy stuff similar to the stuff they know they enjoy and that they won\'t regret it. It is often about the interaction that the audience has with the game as that is often the most important part of an interactive medium.\n\nBut enter the \"subjective review\". This is a review that starts to float away from those criteria from before and starts to float off into new ones that are a lot less technical. They\'ll focus on themes and what not and work towards more of a movie or book review, mediums where the audiences input doesn\'t matter, in examining rather than the playing aspect. \n\nNow these reviews are fine, but it seems that the transition is happening a bit more abruptly and that\'s where the conflict is. Most consumers don\'t need those examinations because it\'s likely a secondary aspect to their enjoyment or something they\'ll wish to do themselves. Their focus tends to be \"will I get a bang for my buck\". The issue is these two different types of reviews are all being wrapped up in the same system. I mean, would you put a reviewer of how a food visually presents itself in the same category of one of taste? That\'s the issue I see with something like Bayonetta 2.\n\nNow I don\'t really have a solution, but I feel like we shouldn\'t really be conflating the two because in all honesty, they aren\'t the same thing in my opinion. \n\nSo do you feel this is a fair synopsis of the issue?

To explain my question, let me share what made me think of it... but my question is a general one, the example is only to illustrate my point.\n\nI have similar WRs going against the New York Jets and the Atlanta Falcons this week. Yahoo states that NYJ has allowed the 9th fewest points to WRs, while the Falcons have given up the 3rd fewest.\n\nBut glancing at ESPNs statistics, NYJ have allowed the 3rd fewest overall receiving yards and only 3 TDs, which puts them at the top in that category as well. Their stats are similar against passers, allowing the 4th fewest points.\n\nMeanwhile, Atlanta clocks in at 24th best in receiving hards, having allowed a full 50% more receiving yards across 3 games (though also allowing just 3 TDs). THey are 24th against the pass as well (I assumed passing and receiving statistics would be the same, but ESPN has them listed separately and to be thorough I figured I\'d share both.)\n\nSo what is more important? For tight ends, RBs who catch a high volume of passes, and WRs, should we care more about \"fantasy points allowed against X position\" or total passing yards around?\n\nI would assume that if a team allows a lot of passing yards, that is the key statistic. If the ball went to a tight end one week, it can go to a WR the next week-- the specific offensive position getting points would rely more on the offensive scheme and personnel, but the fact that the defense is allowing a lot of points is a systemic weakness in the defense.\n\nDoes that seem accurate? Or can a team really be \"strong against WRs but allow a lot of points against TEs\"?

We have two bodies morphing into one, cells intermingling to create an entirely new being. It\'s works for gems because they are basically holograms, just swapping one hologram for another.

And even then, it\'s really just Connie acting as a leader, exploring her issues and affecting Steven instead. And while I like that in concept of exploration, continuing under that mindset for future appearances just has me worried. I also always had a few thoughts and stories of how being a fusion is more of a horror aspect than how it\'s portrayed in Steven Universe, not being your own being, but also not really being your composite parts.

I look back and see that awareness campaigns typically expands people\'s knowledge and it\'s how in general these things start. But it just doesn\'t seem to be working. Not only is it ignored, it is often times strictly opposed, making the message obscured and hidden under slander. How is awareness supposed to lead to actual change if the message just isn\'t being taken by people, what will it take for people to care?\n\nI just think about the Earl Silverman case and I just feel little hope. The man made the government point out their own failures to help men which they then just simply did not see as a problem. How did such a situation like this not make the government think it may need to try and rectify this oversight? Then on top of that, the man did the one of the biggest acts to raise awareness for a cause, killing himself, and nothing was ever made of it. A man literally killing himself (and the thousands of others who aren\'t making a message) is apparently not enough for people to see an issue here, to continue going on with their lives like nothing ever happened.\n\nSo what the hell is it going to take for people to care?

Patrick Hurley was identified by the Placer County Sheriff’s Office as the intruder who came out of the bushes, jumped the fence surrounding the football field and wandered onto the field. At the game watching his son Stone Sander play for the Placer High team was off-duty Lt. Troy Minton-Sander, of the Placer County Sheriff’s Office, who first walked and then ran onto the field to subdue Hurley. Hurley, of the Colfax area, had walked onto the field and picked up the football during the second quarter. Sgt. Ty Conners, commander of the sheriff’s station in Colfax, said the incident happened within “probably 10 seconds. A large male, acting irrational, who might have a weapon, is on a field with kids. … He had to do something in order to protect the kids.” Conners said that Hurley was wearing a belt that to Minton-Sander appeared to be a knife or a sheath. Conners said that even though other off-duty officers also stepped forward later to help, at the time Minton-Sander noticed Hurley was by himself and Minton-Sander determined the best technique to use was to tackle Hurley to the ground and wait until help arrived. It took “five to six experienced law enforcement officers to control this guy, in order to handcuff him,” Conners said. Minton-Sander, said Conners, “was off duty, on his own, putting himself in danger to subdue the subject. He did an outstanding job.” Sheriff’s spokesman Lt. Mark Reed said that as a law enforcement officer, Minton-Sander had also noticed that as cold as it was outside, Hurley was not wearing a shirt. “It’s an indication to law enforcement that he could be under the influence of some dangerous drugs,” Reed said. Reed said Hurley was charged with disorderly conduct/drunk in public. Even though he was not tested, Reed said Hurley’s demeanor and “objective symptoms” indicated he was under the influence. Reed said Hurley was released Saturday morning with the promise to appear in court. Judi Cowart-Anderson was at Friday’s football game watching her two grandsons play for the Falcon teams. She saw Hurley, whom she described as “half-dressed and pants that looked like they weren’t pulled up,” go on the field. “He had to be on something,” she said. “It took five to six involved trying just to get him down … They did not use too much force in getting him off the field.” Cowart-Anderson feels the incident should never have happened. “Somebody had to know him and know that he was taking something or on something to make him act like this,” she said. Rob Hitchcock, a Colfax High assistant principal and athletic director, said Hurley gained access to the field on the visitor side of the football field. Hitchcock said Hurley was observed “acting weird” before he flopped over the fence on the Placer side of the field. “He didn\'t come through the front gate, where the ticket booth is, in that condition,” Hitchcock said. “If we notice someone stumbling around, we have security measures in place.” “We have a series of gates that funnel (the public) to ticket booths,” Hitchcock said. “We have another series of barriers and gates that are manned by our faculty/staff members. Beyond that the field is circled by the fence.” The fence on the visitors’ side, at the backside of the field, is locked but not patrolled as much, and that’s “probably where he got in,” he said. Law enforcement is trained to make decisions about how to handle sensitive situations, “and we respect the decision they made.” Hitchcock said. “They’ve got great training and recognize a dangerous scenario. It could have been very devastating.” Gold Country Media’s Matthew Kimel contributed to this report. ---------- For images of the aftermath of Minton-Sander tackling Hurley to the ground and the efforts of six men to subdue him, visit our photo gallery \"Man wanders on field, gets tackled.\" ',1,1,0,0,'3o0boa'),(65,1444394621,'kingofthefeminists','r/Showerthoughts',0,'Life\'s goal is to make sure as many people as possible are sad when you die.','[removed]',5,17,0,0,'3o3f0y'),(1,1444395231,'kingofthefeminists','r/MarkMyWords',0,'MMY: Trump won\'t make it past Super Tuesday.','[removed]',1,1,0,0,'3o3g95'),(6,1444395839,'kingofthefeminists','r/MarkMyWords',0,'MMW Trump won\'t make it past Super Tuesday.','',2,5,0,0,'3o3hg1'),(9,1444417211,'geminia999','r/GGdiscussion',1,'The term \"reactionary\"','I wish to discuss this term since it is one I see quite often here and in other Self proclaimed progressive communities.\n\nFrom what I\'ve see used, Reactionary is used to describe someone who acts in ways to counter act people trying to change things.

I wish to discuss this topic here and to what extents this stuff goes.\n\nNow personally, I never really got into the idea of power fantasy, I play for the gameplay, the challenge the game provides, to witness the story, as a distraction or whatever, not really ever to make myself feel powerful. So the general mater of fact aspect I see when speaking about such characters seems very strange to me as I can never really see myself acting out the fantasy in the first place.\n\nNow I have some questions. First, what makes a character a power fantasy in your eyes? What are the typical design aspects needed, what are some examples, where is the line between a power fantasy and \"objectification\" are there any subversions you are aware of?\n\nHow does intent of the creator mater versus the interpretation of the player? Often I see in feminist circles the application of death of the author, but when applying it to these characters it seems we return back to authorial intent to decide what a character is supposed to be. So if a player interprets a character often considered objectified as being a power fantasy, who is right? If a player does not project their fantasy onto a power fantasy character do they no longer have that aspect and become objectified characters?\n\nHow does sexuality fit into all this? As one of the common points brought up to differentiate the two, it\'s often considered that typically male muscular/sexual characters are for the men\'s fantasy rather than women\'s objectification, and that female strong/sexual characters are for men\'s objectification rather than women\'s fantasy. But a counter point often brought up is that part of these fantasies is the idea of being attractive and desired by the opposite sex, so how does that effect all this? Ex. Is there really much difference between Conan and a romance novel hunk (as romance novels are a women dominated market)?\n\nIs there a factor that could elevate a typical power fantasy character out of being a power fantasy character? To elaborate, would an action done by said character, or trauma faced, elevate a character outside of said role?\n\nHow exactly does Bayonetta fit into all of this? Bayonetta is generally seen as an example of both of these factors and I wish to ask your opinion. A bit of background in case you are unfamiliar, Bayonetta was designed by a female who said she was trying to make her power fantasy through her. In addition to this it is also said that the director wanted Bayonetta\'s design to also be quite sexy for people\'s enjoyment. In this case it seems that Bayonetta simultaneously fulfills both roles. Do any of those ideas  counteract one of the other? Can a character be both, and if so, what does it say about the concepts of both a power fantasy character and objectification?\n\nI could ask more but I think this is enough for now as I just generally don\'t get one of the perspectives on these characters and disagree with the other, but this seems good enough to get discussion going where I\'d like it to.',13,145,0,0,'3oirr2'),(0,1444704035,'kingofthefeminists','r/politics',0,'\"[Sanders] will not last... the hard left in American politics that Mr Sanders represents is almost dead.

But Bill is a bit odd in that he doesn\'t really seem to follow through on his side of the bargain rather than granting it but putting a horrible twist on it.\n\nI mean, we have Bill making a deal with Dipper, the password to the computer (technically \"all the secrets of the universe\") for a puppet. He does put his nice twist in choosing Dipper as his puppet, but he never actually tells him what the password was.\n\nWe then also have this deal done with Mabel, where he would give an endless summer for the rift. He is given the rift, then likely will not follow through on it (unless his plan technically ends in that happening as a side effect).\n\nThen there is Ford and Bill, which while we don\'t know the specifics of it\'s wording, we do see Bill saying \"a deal\'s a deal\" which implies he does have some sense of holding out deals, even if they are tricks.\n\nLast is then only Gideon\'s contact, which had specifications for Gideon\'s end later and with Bill failing, likely never came to fruition. His second deal will likely be dealt with in the next episode, but considering he appears to have a bulldozer army, it seems Gideon did get something in this exchange.\n\nFinally there\'s Blendin, who we can probably presume didn\'t get something in return (though we\'ll see next episode since It\'ll likely be addressed).\n\nBut considering Sock Opera is really the one deal we get to see done to it\'s full extent, we can see that Bill doesn\'t have a desire to really fulfill his ends of a deal if it doesn\'t benefit him.

Because each voice is unique, we don\'t need to look for other ways to discern between one speaker and another. \n\nUnfortunately for your book, you do. The lack of audio means you have to make voices stand out in other ways. Fortunately, the brain is very good at recognizing patterns, and then associating those patterns with specific objects or individuals. \n\nFor each character you have dialogue with you should try to establish certain patterns of speech that will make them more easily identifiable. Here are some factors you can take into consideration. \n\n1. Vocabulary: Probably the easiest way to separate characters. People\'s vocabularies vary independently of intelligence by the way, it depends completely on exposure to words. So the university educated man should speak with more diverse words than his country bumpkin cousin, who might repeat the same word three times in a sentence. Latin based words particularly tend to sound fancier and more sophisticated, consider the difference between saying someone is \"Smart\" and \"Intelligent.\"\n\n2. Catchphrases. You never need to write \"said Gatsby\" when every other sentence of his ends in \"Old sport.\" Likewise, a character who always starts his thoughts with \"Well,\" or \"Y\'know\" will be easily recognized.\n\n3. Sentence length. Some people speak in short sentences, others ramble. This should fit your character; a direct and to the point person probably won\'t spew a paragraph of thoughts about his ice cream. \n\n4. Fluency. Not everybody produces a smooth, fluid sentence every time. Does your character think it through before speaking or no? If not, then he might open with a \"But, what about, hold on...\" Stuttering or imperfect speech is very normal, make it a part of your characters.\n\n5. Exclamations, Questions, Orders and Statements. Try to pick one of these for your character to use more. One who uses a lot of sarcastic rhetorical questions will stand out as much as one who frequently exclaims things with passionate energy. If your character is bossy his speech will start with more verbs indicating commands, whereas one who is less imposing will open with more \"I think\" or \"Maybe\" or \"We could\". \n\n6. Accents. Put them to use, if one character always drops the g in -ing, it\'ll make him easier to pinpoint in a conversation. \n\nHave anything else I may have forgotten? What else works for you? \n\nEdit: I wrote this up in a fairly succinct way. As some have mentioned, this does not imply that your character must **always** speak in a certain fashion, nor that *all* of your characters must use *all* of these elements. Moderation is also beneficial when applying these tips to your work. I used the Gatsby example a little bit tongue-in-cheek, for instance. I find it gets old quick if overused, although you\'ll probably just end up not noticing it after the 50th time.',7,26,0,0,'3oqkpq'),(0,1444859263,'kingofthefeminists','r/politics',0,'Krueger: 15$ minimum wage a risk not worth taking','',4,8,0,0,'3os070'),(2,1444859719,'braininajar8','r/leagueoflegends',0,'when will one for all come out?','[removed]',1,3,0,0,'3os19h'),(21,1444860278,'Impacatus','r/CMVLikeIAmA',0,'CMV: I am the man who arranges the blocks that continue to fall from up above.

The thief is taking the \"best cut of meat.\"\n\nNo mention is made of the issue that I was most curious about: how were the cattle killed? I suppose they probably cut their throats, but without any kind of restraint, it\'s still something I\'d like to know. It\'s interesting that the author fails entirely to mention anything about the welfare of the cattle. I suspect if it were a dog cut up, they\'d mention whether he was killed \"humanely\" or if he suffered.\n\nBut what really lead me to post this was the following paragraph:\n\n>One rancher, Jeremy Wasylyszyn of Cherryville, is offering a $10,000 [$7,600 USD] reward for information leading to arrest and conviction of the beef-obsessed cow killer. \n\nIsn\'t it interesting that the label \"cow killer\" is being used here as a derogatory description? Not to mention \"beef-obsessed\"?\n\n>someone is going around shooting their cows and carving out select cuts\n\n>He described to CBC how, within the window of about two and a half to three hours, he had seen a female cow and her calf alive and well, then returned to the same area to find the tenderloins of both animals removed.\n\nAgain, can you imagine that description used with a dog or a cat? They \"removed the tenderloins\" or \"carved out select cuts\" rather than using words that convey the horrific nature of the actions?\n\nIt *is* relevant to the story, I recognize, since it helps us to speculate on the motivations of the criminally premature cow-killer. But there\'s very little wording that is meant to convey how horrific the action actually was. The closest it comes is in the closing paragraph:\n\n>One wonders what kind of dish the BC cow killer was so desperate to make that they worked up the moxie to murder another man\'s livestock and hastily hack off meat from the bodies—perhaps they just wanted to get the freshest cut possible for a lonely candlelit dinner of a creamy stroganoff complete with sautéed cremini mushrooms and onions, accompanied by a nice chianti.\n\nThis one kind of makes my head spin. There\'s a couple things going on here. First, apparently if you kill a cow too early, it invokes comparisons to human cannibalism, while if you wait until the slaughterhouse does it, you\'re just eating beef? (If you\'re not in the loop, the language is meant to evoke Hannibal Lector\'s human meat consumption in Red Dragon/Silence of the Lambs/Hannibal Lector.) And second, the entire reason that those words are so chilling is that the criminal says them nonchalantly about human organs, as if he were ordering a steak.\n\nThere should seriously be a college class on analyzing news and literature from a vegan worldview, the way there are on analyzing the same from a feminist perspective. I feel like you could make a very interesting and informative semester on it, even for non-vegans.\n\nedit-- Reddit discussion here, for further analysis: https://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3q11cr/somebody_is_carving_select_cuts_from_canadian/',8,18,1,0,'3q2yal'),(35,1445732455,'meMidFUALL','r/AdviceAnimals',0,'I might die of hunger','',1,2,0,0,'3q3et6'),(6,1445747546,'geminia999','r/GGdiscussion',1,'About emailing advertisers','I wanted to go more into the logistics of this as the opinions on this subject seems to be pretty split.\n\nTo start off I\'ll try to summarize how the email campaigns worked from my understanding. The email campaigns were directed at advertisers of websites that the people suggesting thought advertisers should know how they feel as well as stating actions done by the websites. They were/are done to show the advertisers an opinion about their ads being displayed and associated with such sites and to let the companies come to a conclusion on whether to support the sites or not. These emails additionally did not mention the movement of GG or the controversy assuming they followed the guide lines typical set up by the OP.\n\nThese seemed to have a modicum of success in advertisers pulling out, potentially being a factor in costing gawker at least a million dollars, and as of right now have seemed to be all but none existent on KiA (not sure about 8chan or twitter), mostly due to rules by admins (potentially selectively) saying you could not link a direct email in these type of posts.\n\nNow I have a few questions to enable discussion.\n\nDo you feel such actions are an act of censorship, if so, why, if not, why?\n\nDo people have the right to let advertisers know how they feel about their brand being attached to certain websites through adverts, and if so, is it an okay act?\n\nDoes removing funding of a voice prevent such voice from speaking, and if so, are taking those voices to other platforms (such as general talk or another paying platform) an acceptable solution?\n\nDo you feel such actions are to try and change what people say as a threat, and if so, does it counter beliefs about ones ability to tell advertisers their opinions.\n\nI feel these are some good questions to try and get both sides thinking, if not, feel free to suggest some and I\'ll add them to the post.\n\nEdit: Some suggested questions\n\nIs contacting advertisers substantially (ethically?) different to contacting retailers?

I dislike harassment, I know it\'s wrong, I don\'t participate in it and I know I\'d hate to be bombarded by it, yet I can\'t really muster up sympathy for the people on the other side here. I understand what they face, but I just don\'t really feel bad for them.\n\nAnd maybe it\'s because I\'m a monster (I would like to think that isn\'t the case), but I think it\'s just how I relate to and interpret the individuals it\'s happening to. I mean, doesn\'t it make some sense to not really feel sad when bad things happen to \"bad\" people (bad being the individual\'s interpretation)? But while it\'s something that can be rationalized away, it\'s not really something that makes me feel good about not feeling sympathy, yet it\'s still something I can\'t really force.\n\nAnother thing I\'ve considered is that I guess I fail to see them as victims. Sure, by definition they are victims, but through several pieces after pieces of how these individuals are trudging through all of this harassment, they appear as survivors. I don\'t really see how it actually harms them, the pain that is has caused, the feelings of actually being hurt. Why do I need to feel bad for the person who has apparently overcome adversity?

It is the idea of not seeing people\'s race and ideally treating everyone the same and that this is the appropriate solution to solving racial issues. If everyone were to see each other as just people, rather than individual aspects that divide us, there would be less discrimination and eventually hopefully lead to a society without racial bias.\n\nThe counter to this approach is that it does not account for the biases already in place in society, and thus treating everyone the same wouldn\'t help alleviate that issue, with the idea that people would then stay at the same levels that they started at.

During the ZeXal era it seemed pretty typical for an archetype to get three packs of support plus some TCG exclusives. This typically allowed core archetype mechanic in the first pack, support for that style of play or ways to play the deck somewhat differently but definitely improves upon the deck, and then a little something else in the third pack. Throw in some TCG exclusives that could be really awesome support or something that at least encouraged some deviation (Abyssmander is still one of my favourite Exclusives because it allowed for a completely different approach to the deck that isn\'t inherently bad, just is outclassed a bit) and you would get quite a few healthy archetypes whose biggest issue was the existence of Judgment and D-Rulers.\n\nBut as soon as we entered Arc-V, archetypes really haven\'t been really doing it for me. We first start off with three extremely tight archetypes being introduced, and while I do generally enjoy them all and they are pretty tight from that first wave of release, they never really got much else afterwards. Outside of one or two support cards per pack plus a boss monster, they really didn\'t get any main deck monsters anymore (shaddolls only got Hound for example). And while it\'s a bit understandable from being front loaded for the first pack, every archetype introduced in subsequent packs is pretty much following this trend or even worse, getting just one pack of support (Aromage anyone?). I mean look at Igknights, they get introduced and have something going on, surely the next set is going to expand on them right? Nope, we get two more monsters that do help a bit and a support card that isn\'t really helpful. But that\'s it, no new boss monster, no great support, just generic monsters that don\'t actually improve the faults of the deck fully. I mean, are we really going to expect that Dinomist is going to get the support it needs to be a great deck from two main deck monsters and one support card?\n\nEven looking at TCG excluisves there is a bit of disapointment. While a TCG exclusive could be extremely helpful in making an archetype even better, we don\'t get that any more to focus efforts on building larger exclusive archetypes at a faster pace than noble knights. And while I\'m pretty okay with this approach, it feels like we don\'t really need two going on simultaneously when one is obviously being favourited (Do UAs or Kaiju even have any holos?) to allow some of that archetype support that has been greatly lacking.\n\nAnd while I can support the idea of moving away from archetypes if that was the way they wanted to go, but that is clearly not the case considering we keep getting them.

They expand that if the publication betrays the trust of these companies, they have no obligation to offer them info or review copies (which they then profit off of).

The illegality of obscenity, hate speech, and similar extreme fringes of speech, are constantly challenged by activists, under the assumption that even the smallest amount of legal censorship sets a dangerous precedent, and if we allow them we will be one step away from a Fahrenheit 451 style dystopia. \n\nYet at the same time, with a set of elaborate justifications, we have allowed the existence of a system where *artists can be legally persecuted for publishing their own writings, or even forced not to make them visible at all*, based on their \"derivative\" relation to another IP holder\'s work. \n\nThere seem to be the following justifications for that: \n\n**1. Quality**: The kind of \"art\" that copyright laws stop from publishing is trash like fanfiction novels, or weird asian knockoff movies, and so on. \n\n**2. Originality**: Derivativeness is uncreative, we need to inspire artists to create something more fresh. \n\n**3. Ownership**: People should own what they create. If someone creates a fantasy universe, or a comic book hero, they should own every aspect of it\'s usage. \n\n\nThe first argument seems to miss the fact that these derivatives are amateurish and cheap *because* they are criminalized. The latest Sherlock Holmes TV series aren\'t cheaper than any others, and Alan Moore\'s League of Extraordinary Gentlemen graphic novel doesn\'t have a worse writing style, than any of his other works. Why wouldn\'t the same principle apply to works that have younger, still copyrighted sources, if they were allowed to be used the same way? \n\nThe second argument seems to believe that new IP is the same thing as a creatively refreshing work. But creating a new IP seems to take as little as the last stop in rewriting the character names in Twilight fanfiction to turn it into 50 Shades of Grey, while actually writing a story is where the creative value is. \n\nAlso, both of these arguments imply that it\'s OK to censor creative work as long as it\'s trashy, or not artistic enough.  But how would you feel if the government legally banned the release of zombie movies, or comic book adaptations, with that excuse? \n\nThe third argument misses that the usage of someone else\'s creative work, is creative work in itself. This creates an inequality, where some creators are so heavily rewarded, that they gain control over their work, including *the control to actively suppress other people\'s creative work*. Simply letting all creators own their specific writings, would be a lot more balanced principle of creative ownership.\n',3,7,0,0,'3weezm'),(33,1449870657,'steelerfaninperu','r/hypotheticalsituation',0,'All farts are as loud as gunshots.','Not all farts have the same volume though, so an SBD becomes a silenced .22 pistol and a real earth shattering blast rattles the room like a cannon.',11,26,0,0,'3wfls9'),(5,1449889962,'MultiAli2','r/words',0,'What is another word more poetic word/phrase/slang for eyebrows?','I\'m writing a song and I\'m trying to say this girl has great eyebrows.

Jay-Z\'s service, Tidal is monumental - I believe that under the right conditions and the right appeal, it could turn the whole music industry around. But, I don\'t think Hov is really capitalizing on all the opportunities at hand. So, you know how Tidal has the whole hifi deal, fairly compensates artists, promotes new artists, music videos, social media feeds, and exclusive content thing going on, like the whole artist is neatly ordered in one place. Well, I got to thinking about how they sold tickets to the TidalX1020 concert in the platform and I said \"well, why don\'t they sell every artists\' tickets\". Then, later on, on twitter I saw Prince was upset about ticket scalping - his tickets had gone on sale on resale sites before they had officially been released and resell restrictions were being ignored on secondary sites. Ultimately, both fans and the artists are screwed in that sort of situation because most of the money comes from touring nowadays. So I said, \"why doesn\'t Tidal - a platform dedicated to the promotion and fair treatment/compensation of recording artists - both sell tickets to artists\' shows on their site and create a sort of social networking aspect to the deal for the purpose of giving buyers a place to congregate and resale tickets in a fashion that doesn\'t screw fans and artists over?\" \n\n\nSo, now I\'m thinking of organizing some sort of business plan regarding adding a social-ticket resale aspect to the platform and at least submitting the idea to Jay Z or the Tidal HQ or whatever (idk how to get into contact with Hov or anyone who has a say in it), but I don\'t know much about how the ticketing industry works in the first place. \n\n\nI know that because Tidal is new and people don\'t appreciate music, the company probably doesn\'t have the kind of revenue to spend on such a project, so I understand that such an idea may have to come into being separately and merge with Tidal later on.

Garnet has always been shown as a fusion of love, of being a literal embodiment of love between R&S, yet I feel this episode in explaining her origins doesn\'t really gel with this presentation.\n\nIn the episode, this is seemingly Ruby and Sapphire\'s first meeting, with the Rubies just being her guards for this trip. Knowing this, the rest of the episode up until Garnet\'s formation, their relationship doesn\'t really ever seem to really develop past VIP and Bodyguard. We have ruby being pushed into Sapphire and her then apologizing, which seems generally in line with everything. We have them making some small talk, which is really just small talk. Finally we go into Ruby rescuing Sapphire which just did not seem like the lynch pin to show these people are in love. The way it\'s phrased seemed to suggest to me that Ruby just was not giving up in her job, rather than it being her care. So now we have Garnet being formed and then we start developing their relationship from this point which is mostly fine.\n\nHowever, this is kind of my issue. We have the idea that Garnet is made of love, that she is their relationship taken form. Yet the idea presented in this episode seems to be more along the lines of, we fused, so now we love each other. Instead of Garnet being formed due to their relationship, it seemed more their relationship was formed because of Garnet. This is further shown by how the two are talking about it, with a lot of their focus on the experience rather than developing them as individuals who grew into it. We end with Garnet saying \"why does she want to be like this\" with the end answer being \"love\", but I just can\'t see love being fully formed by then. So now we have Garnet seemingly already fully ready to be who she is at her second fusion, with these two now fully in love with each other.\n\nAnd while I can see that an okay for a story, it seems way too fast and just doesn\'t really represent what the relationship was being presented as. I don\'t know, maybe it\'d make more sense if we actually knew how Homeworld acted more (are we really to expect that a gem doing their job is so out of the ordinary it can change the future?), but right now it just feels more like a love at first sight scenario rather than a fully developed relationship that thus led to Garnet. It just feels like that would have been the must better approach that worked more with how it has been portrayed beforehand.\n\nAnyone else here feel the same way and somewhat disappointed?',12,29,0,0,'41ftu7'),(1,1453085496,'kingofthefeminists','r/Music',0,'David Bowie - Sue (Or in a Season of Crime) [Rock; better mix than in his album]','',1,1,0,0,'41gxac'),(0,1453162962,'MultiAli2','r/AskReddit',0,'Reddit, what\'s your theory on why this generation is so butthurt about everything all the time?','[removed]',6,10,0,0,'41lxx7'),(3,1453172704,'Generic_Lad','r/Coins4Sale',1,'[WTS] Scarce date florin, large lot of Swiss silver','http://imgur.com/a/XoGYF\n\nUsual disclaimers.

From the comics it’s described by Amethyst as “like a wallet, but more infinite” which makes the inside of the gem temple a physical possibility. We can also presume it’s customizable, which then would work with the gems constructing the test in the temple as well as Rose’s Room.\n\nSo theoretically, it could work, the question now becomes, would the crystal gems (or specifically Rose) essentially enslave a gem to make their temple, and if so, where is the gem?\n\nNow for the first, I don’t really think is that likely, but then again, Pearl thought very little about the gem mirror and the implications of a gem being attached. Presumably the gems are just extremely used to the idea of using gems as tools that even that was not really considered when rebelling. In this case, it would make sense to an extent that they would use a gem to make the temple.\n\nThough, if one is not really fond of that explanation, I figure the temple’s properties would then have to do something with the gem heart. In that scenario I would guess that the crystal heart is essentially a gem with no personality, one created specifically for the purpose of just projecting such an area (or powering other objects such as the kindergarten and hand ship). Though one has to question if the method for creating these things is similar to the kindergartens.\n\nBut returning to the idea that it is a gem making the temple, one has to question where it is. Now a quick guess would assume the door with the 5 gems on it, in which case, it’d be about 5 gems powering the temple which seems a bit too much if it’s basically infinite. Another could be that it’s just one we haven’t seen which is possible. But the one answer that would make the most sense to me if this was the case, would be the one gem we really question it’s purpose, Bismuth.\n\nIf it was Bismuth, it would explain quite a few things. Why Bismuth is not in the temple (presumably storing the gem inside itself would be impossible), why Bismuth is in such a secure location as having the temple anywhere else would put it in danger (and all the gems inside it). Bismuth also to me just makes sense design wise as it’s straight edge, man-made, multicolour aspects just work really well for what would be a dedicated gem to making a base.\n\nWhile I do like that thought a lot, it brings us back to another question, what is bubbling like for another gem? We have three examples of gems being bubbled and released, Steven, Centipeetle and Peridot. From Steven, we know that a bubble doesn’t do much to a formed being as they are still conscious and can move around. Centipeetle we see getting poofed as well as the reforming process, where she just tries to reform as soon as being released, but with the caveat of being corrupted so that she attempts to form as her regular form, then going to giant centipeetle, and then pocket size, suggesting reforming is an active process to some extent. But then we have Peridot who then when reforming continues her actions until she realized what happened. This is the most interesting one, as it suggests Peridot was essentially frozen in time as we see no other gem when reforming to act in such a manner, suggesting it’s the property of the bubbling. Under this assumption, having the temple be Bismuth would suggest it’s frozen in time to some extent. Now this could work either way as I see it. Either it’s proof Bismuth can’t be the temple, as otherwise it’d be frozen, or that it’s only freezing the consciousness of Bismuth explaining the lack of such a presence in the temple itself. Or it’s not frozen at all in which case this all works.\n\nThis is all just stuff I thought up in a few minutes, but I’d really love it if Bismuth actually was a character we’ve seen since the fourth episode to an extent, and we just never knew it.',4,11,0,0,'436rf0'),(14,1454040567,'ineedfreedom','r/TumblrPls',0,'Otherkin Problem #1: Feeling Your Astral Limbs During a Test','',6,14,1,0,'4375t3'),(2,1454076967,'kingofthefeminists','r/politics',0,'Sanders\'s long-awaited health care plan is vague and unrealistic.','',0,0,0,0,'438y29'),(10,1454093129,'geminia999','r/GGdiscussion',0,'What qualifies as misogyny to you?','So one term that loves to rear it\'s head into discussion is the term misogyny.

But what I love the most is just how the world is built through the environment and other unique factors.\n\nTo start, Garnet\'s mission was one to specifically find the locations of the geo beetles, one at the boiling lava lake and the sky spire. Not only does this introduce us to two cool locations (and an ability of Garnet), it tells us that these beetles are important in that their locations were recorded.\n\nWe then visit the Sky Spire and we also see a lot of things that make us question things. We can see that this was a place people were at before due to the pathway leading to the spire itself. We then also see beetle iconography decorating the pathway cementing the importance of the beetle to this area.\n\nThen we finally get to the spire itself, and it\'s here that we see what is the most intriguing aspect in all of this, a floating rock with a tiny temple on it that is filled with miniature 90\'s human products (presumably non functioning). This is quite great as it makes you wonder how that stuff even got there, humans apparently worship this thing to an extent to have a dedicated area, and this is still something that is extremely recent considering the model items are from the 80-90\'s (Sega genesis and a gameboy). It just gets one really thinking what is the back story of this place, that such an old looking temple has such modern stuff for what is seemingly just a creature with no power. This is fantastic and is what really sets home the world building and the questions the show can make you ask.\n\nNow we\'re not entirely done as we still have one more thing to cover, the Crow monster. Now before even addressing the world building aspect, this creature gets props from me for being a fusion, which just adds onto the fusion aspect of this episode, and does so without ever drawing attention to that fact, which is fantastic. But the crow also to an extent world builds by showing us what\'s inside it, and here we see a pile of a bunch of modern junk. This is interesting as it shows that the bird has apparently been somewhat close to humans if it could eat that stuff, and it also to an extent makes us wonder why it would it this stuff. It gives us a little sense of scale to where it\'s been and what it has been doing before we\'ve come to this encounter.\n\nNow that\'s about it for this episode by itself, but that\'s quite a lot of info, especially so early in the series when we didn\'t even fully understand who the gems where. It gives a real sense of a background to the place that we don\'t even really address at all.\n\nSo lastly, I just kind of want to go over what new info that adds to what we already have from this episode and just what it adds, despite also not being directly addressed. First, we\'ve learned from a tweet that the Beetles are corrupted gems, which is quite interesting considering all the other corrupted gems, as these ones are tiny and non violent. We\'ve seen the bird monster on the totem pole which suggests it either a thing that is somewhat common, or had at least some affect on humans. We\'ve also learned about how fusion is treated by gems relating back to the crow monster and makes us wonder if this another experiment on gem fusion by homeworld (which goes back to what is corruption), whether this is something several corrupted gems just ended up doing, or maybe they were fused at the time and then corrupted.\n\nLastly, we now know that the sky spire was a planned construction by the gems, which can gives us quite a lot of insight into the role of these beetles. This does seemingly confirm the two of having a somewhat important roles to the gems if they would get a dedicated building for them. And considering the path, we can suspect they were already corrupted at this point in time. It just brings up so many questions as to how important these things were to gems and what exactly corruption is. \n\nThis is all from background info that was never mentioned in the show, yet we can gleam so much from it. This is just makes me want to explore the world and just see what is going on and why things are. This episode brings up so many ideas, that from even further info can determine may be incredibly important. It\'s just great and was a real great push into getting me fully engrossed in the show.',3,3,0,0,'43l58b'),(0,1454354849,'Impacatus','r/AskScienceFiction',0,'[Log Horizon]How are these various guilds able to hold players hostage?','I\'m only six episodes into this series, but I must have missed this explanation.

When that happened, I assumed that it was just some glitchy issue, and that I was already in the pset1 folder and for some reason it hadn\'t been showing up right.

I thought I would share a few of my favorites from different eras to illustrate a few points:\n\n1. We often point out that TRP is truth, this needs no further explanation. Literature is a means of finding the truth in life. The best authors have always striven to discover the truth of the world around them, and capture that in writing.\n\n2. TRP principles are as old as human civilization itself, if not older. For as long as writing has existed, you can find the same messages that we preach here.\n\n**Let\'s start** with the oldest surviving text on the planet (~2000 BCE): [The Epic of Gilgamesh](http://www.aina.org/books/eog/eog.pdf). The first paragraph after the introduction reads:\n\n> GILGAMESH went abroad in the world, but he met with none who could withstand his arms till be came to\nUruk. But the men of Uruk muttered in their houses, ‘[...] His lust leaves no virgin to her lover, neither the warrior\'s daughter nor the\nwife of the noble; yet this is the shepherd of the city, wise, comely, and resolute.\'\n\nFirst sentence of the oldest text ever points out what quality? Gilgamesh\'s ripped-as-fuck arms. Other men in town hate the dude because he scores all the women. \n\n**Lesson**: Go workout. Haters gonna hate, don\'t give a fuck.\n\nMy second selection comes from The Canterbury Tales, specifically [The Merchant\'s Tale.](http://ummutility.umm.maine.edu/necastro/chaucer/translation/ct/11mert.pdf) The tale predates Chaucer\'s version in the late 1300s.\n\nIn the Merchant\'s Tale, a 60-year-old knight (January) wants a 20-year-old wife. However, his friend Justinus warns him:\n\n> And therefore the best counsel I know is, despair not, sir,\nbut have in your memory that perhaps she may be your\npurgatory. She may be God’s instrument and God’s scourge;\nthen shall your soul skip up to heaven swifter than an arrow\nout of a bow. I hope to God that hereafter you shall learn that\nthere is no such felicity in marriage, and never shall be, that\nwill hinder your salvation\n\n**Lesson:** Marriage could be purgatory. \n\nJanuary gets married anyway. On the wedding night they consummate, but the narrator throws this warning out there:\n\n> But God knows what May thought in her heart, when she saw him sitting up in his shirt and nightcap, with his lean neck; she did not think his playing was worth a damn.\n\nMay doesn\'t get the tingles from old-ass January. She DOES get them from his young squire Damien. January goes blind, and while the two sit in his garden, Damien climbs up into a pear tree. May *steps on January\'s back* to climb up and \"get a pear.\" She gets a lot more than that.\n\n**Lesson:** Give her the tingles or someone else will, and she\'ll fuck that person.\n\nJanuary\'s sight miraculously returns in time to see Damien plowing his wife. What does May say?\n\n>  “On peril of my soul, I lie not; it was taught me that to heal\nyour eyes there was nothing better than to struggle with a man\nup in a tree. God knows, I did it with good intent.” \n\n**Lesson:** Women hamster their way out of responsibility for their actions.\n\nThe narrator sums it up best at the end:\n\n> “Now I pray God keep me\nfrom such a wife! Lo what tricks and wiles are in women!\nThey are ever as busy as bees to deceive us simple men, and\nthey will ever swerve from the truth, it is well proved by this\nMerchant’s tale.\n\nThe last example comes from F. Scott Fitzgerald\'s short story [Winter Dreams](https://public.wsu.edu/~campbelld/engl494/winterdreams.pdf) (1922). The star of it is Judy Jones, who is smoking hot. She meets Dexter and confides how she feels:\n\n>  I like you. But I\'ve just had a terrible afternoon.\nThere was a man I cared about, and this afternoon he told me\nout of a clear sky that he was poor as a church-mouse. He\'d\nnever even hinted it before. \n\nShe goes on to ask Dexter a question:\n\n> \"Are you poor?\"\n\n> \"No,\" he said frankly, \"I\'m probably making more money than\nany man my age in the Northwest.\n\n> There was a pause. Then she smiled and the corners of her\nmouth drooped and an almost imperceptible sway brought her\ncloser to him, looking up into his eyes. \n\n**Lesson:** Money matters to women.\n\nJudy Jones doesn\'t need to settle for just one wealthy man. She\'s an HB10 and knows it. (My emphasis added)\n\n> He [Dexter] was, as he found before the summer ended, one of a\nvarying dozen who **circulated about her**. Each of them had at\none time been favored above all others--about half of them still\nbasked in the solace of occasional sentimental revivals.\nWhenever one showed signs of dropping out through long\nneglect, she granted him a brief honeyed hour, which\nencouraged him to tag along for a year or so longer.\n\n**Lesson:** Women love having orbiters, and will string them along as long as possible.\n\nThe best part of the story is the ending though, which really confirms everything we know. Dexter has moved on but later finds out Judy is engaged with children, now just looking, and liked by other women. Who is this woman, he wonders.\n\n> \"Lots of women fade just like that,\" Devlin snapped his fingers. \n\n**Lesson:** The wall is real, it drives women\'s actions.\n\nWhat I always tell my students when we study literature is that the things that change are irrelevant. They couldn\'t stand the test of time, they were weak, they matter not. The things that *don\'t* change, those eternal truths, those are the things to pay attention to. I\'ve just shown you 4000 years of RP truth in three texts.

While the dragon rulers would be powerful as a group, I always figured if only one was off the list it would be powerful, but not too broken that it couldn\'t exist in the current game state by itself. \n\nSo when you get to bringing one of the list, it\'s essentially a question of which attribute would you like to have the support of a dragon ruler.

Slushy is one of my favourite cards, and he helps wonders out there. He can mill frogs, slushies or your sea serpents to help set him up, then you can use his summon in conjunction with slushies to get two level 7\'s out, or my personal favourite, get another monster on your field after playing Neo-daedalus (which you can search off dragoons, and summon regular daedalus from slushy\'s eff).

The first is the obvious threat, threatening to do something to an individual, typically a physical crime such as murder or rape. Then there is also doxxing, the posting of private info, typically real name, address, phone number, email address and other info not immediately obvious. This step is one that more or less leads into the above one. Then what I suppose would just be classified as harassment along the lines of cyber bullying, where one insults or continually degrades someone. The last one I could then think of is more along the lines of what was referred to by Anita Sarkeesian and ZQ at the UN panel, where it\'s more a mass volume of more negative messages If you can phrase what their message was better, I\'ll edit it in).\n\nNow for discussion I just wish to know what exactly everyone\'s opinion on this subject is. On one hand, people seem to range from feeling that its a relatively asinine subject, with the solutions being more focused on individuals to take their own initiative to protect themselves or that it can\'t really hurt you, that it really isn\'t such a big deal and that a lot of what is considered online harassment is just not an issue. The other side then seems to consider it a much bigger issue and that its very much equivalent to other forms of harassment, that it\'s on the fault of the websites that run these services to protect their users and that the solution of just shut it off doesn\'t work because of how much the internet is a factor now.\n\nBut even with those summaries, it doesn\'t necessarily say how much of how important an issue this subject actually is. I also would like to discuss how discussion on this harassment also tends to gender who are the victims of it.

Just saying ZeXal sucked or Yuma is whiny isn\'t really going to be very productive so I ask to not do such posts.\n\nI\'ll start with my own personal opinion on the series. Personally, I don\'t dislike ZeXal as much as most people seem to, but I still think it has a lot of problems and is definitely near the bottom of all the yugioh series (I can\'t really judge GX since I haven\'t really looked too much into it since it originally aired dubbed). I\'ll start my analysis with the three main protagonists, Yuma/Astral, Kaito and Shark (I\'ll be sticking to Sub names and not Dub, but I don\'t think most will mind).\n\nYuma/Astral: Now probably a lot of people\'s reaction to these character\'s is pretty negative, and I can\'t really blame people, but I\'m pretty much fine with the two. All the yugioh series have built themselves off certain character relationships (every series having a Kaiba and a Joey) and certain repeated tropes so to return to the Yugi/Atem relationship isn\'t really crossing any lines in my opinion. I Like how it\'s not a simple take over as in the original series as while we know Yugi is a good duelist, we rarely get to see him actually duel. Yuma and astral instead does it in reverse and lets Yuma grow as a duelist and get better. This also works into the fact that Yuma is a lot more fallible then most of the protagonists before him and quite regularly does end up failing a lot early on rather than already starting off the series as the best (even if he still wins in the end due to too high circumstances, but I\'ll get back to that). Personality wise, he did get quite a bit annoying sometimes, but it was never enough to make just not want to watch him and Astral worked as a decent foil.\n\nKaito: He is probably the best of our three protagonists overall in that he has the least failings and there\'s not much else to really say about him. He\'s a Kaiba and he does it really well, starts of very antagonistic and has a pretty great curve in becoming less antagonistic and supportive to Yuma. Otherwise he\'s somewhat generic in that his brother is pretty much just there to act as grounding point and his relationship to Faker isn\'t really explored as much as it should in my opinion. Otherwise, he\'s an okay character without too much obvious things to complain about (outside of Orbital 7)\n\nShark: This is probably the one character I\'m most mixed on if only because I feel like he needed a lot more development than what we ultimately got. He\'s overall the most antagonistic secondary protagonist in the whole series which overall just didn\'t work out that well since Kaito is also quite antagonistic early on. First season he really doesn\'t get too much to shine with and ends up kind of mostly being there because ZeXal is following the formula and he needs to be there. He just feels tacked on first season. We however then get to the second season where he becomes even more antagonistic as Nasch. And honestly, this role given to him just doesn\'t work for me. He didn\'t have much to begin with, and turning him into an antagonist just didn\'t really make him better. It just made me think of him as an idiot, focusing only on the fact he\'s a barian and has to serve them (when all we see of the Barian world is Crystals, 7 people, a fly and a god) ignoring the fact that all the barian\'s were humans in the first place. We just don\'t really have enough to care about this decision as we aren\'t given much of a reason to care. It\'s probably my least favourite aspect of ZeXal when I look back on it.\n\nVillains: ZeXal is odd for me as it has some of the best Villains in the series in it\'s secondary villains, along with some of the most boring in it\'s main ones. Both Dr. Faker and Don Thousand are some of the least developed villains in villains in the series (probably tying with the antagonist of GX\'s first season). They really do just come across as generic bad guys with little motivation outside of being evil. Faker is the better of the two for at least having some motivation, but even then it\'s still quite lame. Don thousand is basically just a generic bad guy with pretty much nothing about him being interesting. But while those two suck a lot, we also have Tron and Vector as some really great antagonists. Tron brings back ideas of Pegasus, but he also is a lot more revenge focused and it works to his favor. Add in the relationship with his sons and he ends up working to being a very memorable character (who then does not reappear in the second season >_>). Finally, we have Vector who is just a really memorable villain. He\'s just really memorable and is just a gigantic asshole which really does work out for him, and having him betray the protagonist like that was probably one of the better villain moves done in the series. Even when he gets a slight redemption at the end, he\'s still an asshole about it and rejects Yuma\'s hand so he is absorbed.\n\nSide Characters: This is where ZeXal fails the most in my opinion, having a gigantic cast of side characters that do nothing. There are just so many characters that get one duel, and then just hang around or show up later as Yuya\'s friends. The flip guy, one duel then he hangs around, class president, doesn\'t even get a duel and hangs around, Anna, gets two duels in the entire series, one being a tag duel, and then don\'t get me started on how useless Kotori is. Of all those characters that hang around, I really only like Cathy, but she gets two duels in the series (one of which she purposefully loses) and Tetsuo who only gets 2 main duels in the series, and his last one is to act as a Warf for IV along with the stupid class president kid. This even extends back to Shark where he really doesn\'t do much in the beginning of the series as well. There\'s just so many characters who are extremely one note and then don\'t ever do anything again outside of being a cheerleading squad for Yuma. And hell, who remembers that Yuma has a sister that does nothing of note throughout the entire series outside of having a relationship to a random opponent Yuma faces despite it easily being possible. The show follows Yuma around too much and really has a lot of issue in variety in that, especially when Yuma is probably the only protagonist with an extremely consistent boss monster that he will summon rather than anything else.\n\nConsequence: This is probably what I feel led a lot to the issues that ZeXal faced as a series and that if this factor was addressed better possibly could have alleviated the burden off of having Yuma/Astral support the entire show. The consequences for Yuma losing almost every duel in the series is astral dying, and this of course greatly limits what can actually happen in the show. From having such a severe consequence straight from the beginning of the show there is no room for loss from Yuma because as soon as he loses, the show is over. This is also a burden that is pretty much exclusively on Yuma for most of the show, meaning that for any duel to have as high of stakes as the last, Yuma needs to be dueling. You can\'t have any of the side characters duel someone instead of Yuma, they don\'t have numbers so they have less of a consequence if they lose, as well as have severe disadvantages. If there was a way for ZeXal to have avoided this, I think it had the possibility to spread itself out more among it\'s cast (though, whether the writer\'s would have utilized them still is another question) and would allow Yuma to actually lose more without caveats. As it is, it set the consequence to the most extreme and stayed there throughout the entire series, only getting higher when losing meant death of everyone else instead.\n\nThat\'s kind of where I feel Arc-V really does improve over ZeXal, the consequences for dueling have been mostly able to stay away from death as a punishment and as such has allowed the characters to lose and actually put people in situations where you don\'t know if they actually will come out on top because they are the protagonist. Arc-V also has a large cast, but despite this, manages to split duels more or less around the entire cast making it so it doesn\'t get saturated.\n\nAnyways, sorry for the long write up, but I\'ve just got thing about the show again and kind of want to describe these aspects more than just a simple \"ZeXal sucks\".',17,80,0,0,'4hjdk5'),(22,1462238728,'steelerfaninperu','r/hypotheticalsituation',0,'The next generation of humans is 9 feet tall','Starting today, all babies born for the next 16 years will grow to an average height of about 9 feet tall, give or take a foot.\n\nThe babies will be born and will grow like regular children until around age 10, when normal growth spurts last much longer and full height is reached in puberty.

This is largely in part due to the fact that the area is kind of a midway point between two of the lords of cinders, those aligned with the abyss watchers and those aligned with Aldritch.\n\nOn my first thought, I think I would clearly say it\'s for the cathedral of the deep and continues off the road of sacrifices and leads to the cathedral itself. But this creates some questions such as why crucify people in the first place. We see carriages knocked on their side in road of sacrifices so presumably that\'s how the sacrifices were transferred so a need to crucify people doesn\'t seem needed (especially when it seems like Aldritch ate people alive). However, it also does explain why there would be no bodies on any of the crosses outside of the specific mobs you encounter (which is another question of some importance).\n\nSo if it\'s not the Cathedral\'s doing, theoretically it\'s then because of the abyss watchers. This one does make a bit more sense to me as the area overall does seem to be more linked to the group as the crystal sage is allied with them meaning you either have to go through him or the exiles to get to the next area, both people connected to farron. But then the question now exactly comes to why. We know that the abyss watchers are relentless about the abyss, but the crucifixion woods doesn\'t really seem to be too much of a populated area and seems more like in general that it was just a fortress in front of the entrance to farron. Where exactly are the people being crucified coming from and why. Then this again returns to why they are all empty except for the mobs we find (which we also find one locked up in Irythill which brings some more questions). Were these crosses actually used to crucify people at all (since they are kind of small)?\n\nI just find it weird how this an area where something is obviously going on, but I really can\'t figure out why as the obvious answers don\'t seem to make too much sense.

Of course, their main location is the road of sacrifices, but even that is a bit weird when we consider them basically messengers of Velka, what exactly are they even doing there. Then we also find the occasional ones just hanging around in weird places such as past the wolf door in Farron Keep, the roof of Lothric Castle and probably the most interesting, the untended graves surrounding the corpse holding the Ashen estus ring. We know what their deal is, but they just have somewhat odd placements that I\'m sure there is a lot more to them, especially with the ashen estus ring.\n\nThe Bloated Dog in Road of Sacrifices\n\nThis is a pretty easy story to parse, but in the road of sacrifices where we get one of the braile tomes and Morne\'s ring, we find two dogs, one of which is unique to all the other dogs in the game as it has a gigantic distended belly. What we can likely presume is that the dogs killed the two of them and then this dude ate them, thus getting the distended belly.\n\nThe Black Knight in Crucifixion Woods\n\nHere is one that I\'m not fully able to place, but in the border between crucifixion woods and Farron Keep we find a lone Black Knight Guarding the Farron Coal. I can\'t really come up for a good reason why he\'s here as it doesn\'t really make much sense as he\'s really the only random black knight we have in the game. The best I can think of is that he somehow wandered there all the way from Demon Ruins, but that\'s a decent trek, and even then, it doesn\'t make much sense for him to stop there. The only other thing is that he sided with the undead legion but there isn\'t anything to really support that outside of him guarding the coal.\n\nThe Evangelist in Irithyll (Dorhys?)\n\nWe make our way to Irithyll and find a lone Evangelist in a gated off area near a tree. Now her placement here isn\'t necessarily too off as the evangelist\'s are affiliated with the deep and Aldritch has made his way over to Irithyll, but she also drops the Dorhy\'s Gnawing Miracle. Now we can presume she\'s Dorhys, but we still don\'t know how exactly she got here and what exactly caused her too linger too long on the darkness to give her her own miracle.\n\nMangrubs in Irithyll river\n\nIn the riverbed of Irithyll we can find a dead Mangrub giving the great heal miracle, which is quite an odd place for them as we know they are affiliated with Rosaria, and from their plentiful nature close to her, we can presume it\'s likely an instant transformation rather than a delayed transformation. So I\'m quite curious how this dude got all the way over here, otherwise, all we can presume is that they are a cleric due to having the miracle (longstretch, maybe Patches? He did at least get to the other side of the cathedral where Rosaria is and we know he can go to Irithyll due to Greirat\'s questline)\n\nThe Silver Knight Room in Irithyll\n\nHere we can assume that these Knights pretty obviously came from Anor Londo, but there is still a question of what exactly they are doing down in Irithyll. They do have Smough\'s Hammer, the Leo Ring and a Divine Blessing, obviously are clear connection to Anor Londo. But a theory I\'ve read and quite like is that these guys are holding out from Pontiff\'s forces and basically barricaded themselves in here (they are also noticeable for being non respawning enemies when we see respawning ones later). With the relics as well we can maybe guess they took them when fleeing.\n\nThe Crucified Prisoner in Irithyll Dungeon\n\nThis is more a personal curiosity then any major one, but I do find this dude\'s placement a bit odd. These guys are only found in Crucifixion woods, yet here we find one prisoner in the dungeon. I\'m just kind of curious how this dude got here since they clearly have a connection to crucifixion woods.\n\nThe Mangrub in the Grand Archives Rafters\n\nHere we have another out of place mangrub, however, there can be a bit more of a story pieced to this one. We find this dude in the rafters near the cage that supposedly held Gertrude, seemingly the Queen\'s Daughter. We know the queen has a relationship to Gwynevere (where it\'s just a relationship or actually her), and we also know Rosaria does as well. From there we can piece a potential relationship between Rosaria and Gertrude and we can presume that she had something to do with the cage being empty, leaving this lone grub as a sign of her being there.\n\nThe Black Knights in Untended Graves\n\nThese guys I included as I\'m not fully sure why they would be at untended graves considering their overall story from DS1.\n\nThe Outrider Knights\n\nThese guys also have kind of a clear cut explanation to them, being Pontiff Knights becoming beasts due to their rings, but I do find their locations to be a bit interesting and potentially telling, those being right before the road of sacrifices, in an armory in Lothric Castle and behind an Illusory wall in the Grand Archives. These dudes, along with Vordt and Dancer also make you question what exactly Pontiff is desiring for them to do at Lothric (seemingly prevent the linking of the fire). But I still kind of wonder if their specific locations add to an even bigger story, as we do find one behind an illusory wall.\n\nAnd of course, the Crab in the Skeleball\n\nThat\'s all the strange enemy placements I could remember and some stories to go along with them, but I know a lot of these do have more meaning to them but I\'m just not sure how.',0,0,0,0,'4ivmdw'),(21,1462991005,'iwillnotgetaddicted','r/vegan',0,'My weekly Yelp ad highlighted vegan eats!','',4,7,0,0,'4iwblw'),(73,1463007871,'geminia999','r/darksouls3',0,'[Lore] Stories from Enemy Placements','One of my favourite part about the lore is some of the little stories you can piece together from item or enemy placements, so I thought I\'d just collect some of the ones that stood out to me as odd and would share. \n\nThe Corvians\n\nI include these guys here as they don\'t really have much of a proper home, but can be found in lots of interesting places.

Now we can presume she\'s Dorhys, but we still don\'t know how exactly she got here and what exactly caused her too linger too long on the darkness to give her her own miracle.\n\nMangrub in Irithyll river\n\nIn the riverbed of Irithyll we can find a dead Mangrub giving the great heal miracle, which is quite an odd place for them as we know they are affiliated with Rosaria, and from their plentiful nature close to her, we can presume it\'s likely an instant transformation rather than a delayed transformation. So I\'m quite curious how this dude got all the way over here, otherwise, all we can presume is that they are a cleric due to having the miracle (longstretch, maybe Patches? He did at least get to the other side of the cathedral where Rosaria is and we know he can go to Irithyll due to Greirat\'s questline)\n\nThe Silver Knight Room in Irithyll\n\nHere we can assume that these Knights pretty obviously came from Anor Londo, but there is still a question of what exactly they are doing down in Irithyll. They do have Smough\'s Hammer, the Leo Ring and a Divine Blessing, obviously are clear connection to Anor Londo. But a theory I\'ve read and quite like is that these guys are holding out from Pontiff\'s forces and basically barricaded themselves in here (they are also noticeable for being non respawning enemies when we see respawning ones later). With the relics as well we can maybe guess they took them when fleeing.\n\nThe Crucified Prisoner in Irithyll Dungeon\n\nThis is more a personal curiosity then any major one, but I do find this dude\'s placement a bit odd. These guys are only found in Crucifixion woods, yet here we find one prisoner in the dungeon. I\'m just kind of curious how this dude got here since they clearly have a connection to crucifixion woods.\n\nThe Mangrub in the Grand Archives Rafters\n\nHere we have another out of place mangrub, however, there can be a bit more of a story pieced to this one. We find this dude in the rafters near the cage that supposedly held Gertrude, seemingly the Queen\'s Daughter. We know the queen has a relationship to Gwynevere (where it\'s just a relationship or actually her), and we also know Rosaria does as well. From there we can piece a potential relationship between Rosaria and Gertrude and we can presume that she had something to do with the cage being empty, leaving this lone grub as a sign of her being there.\n\nThe Black Knights in Untended Graves\n\nThese guys I included as I\'m not fully sure why they would be at untended graves considering their overall story from DS1.\n\nThe Outrider Knights\n\nThese guys also have kind of a clear cut explanation to them, being Pontiff Knights becoming beasts due to their rings, but I do find their locations to be a bit interesting and potentially telling, those being right before the road of sacrifices, in an armory in Lothric Castle and behind an Illusory wall in the Grand Archives. These dudes, along with Vordt and Dancer also make you question what exactly Pontiff is desiring for them to do at Lothric (seemingly prevent the linking of the fire). But I still kind of wonder if their specific locations add to an even bigger story, as we do find one behind an illusory wall.\n\nAnd of course, the Crab in the Skeleball\n\nThat\'s all the strange enemy placements I could remember and some stories to go along with them, but I know a lot of these do have more meaning to them but I\'m just not sure how.',22,57,0,0,'4ixp87'),(7,1463074426,'braininajar8','r/eu4',0,'Kingdom of jerusalem ideas better than knights?','So i just formed kingdom of jerusalem but i am not that good at the game but which ideas are better,knights or jerusalem.',1,3,0,0,'4j1u0k'),(12,1463085545,'Impacatus','r/CapitalismVSocialism',0,'Capitalists (in the sense of investors/entrepreneurs) DO contribute to the production process','Risk, savings, innovation, organization and more are necessary to the production process.\n\nYou could argue that a socialist co-op could do all those things, but that doesn\'t change the fact that capitalists do them.\n\nIt\'s like hiring a housekeeper, then complaining that you pay them for nothing because you could do your own cleaning.

This is mostly due to the fact that pendulum can be a very powerful mechanic if not restrained, so just having a random archetype like Fire Fist and turning them all into pendulums would greatly boost what the deck could do through no real effort. It would become greatly powerful without much to keep that aspect in check. As such, most pendulum decks have been designed around a limiting factor of some sort or having relatively little consistency at all to not allow the decks be able to do so much.\n\nSo with those factors in mind, I want to ask what pendulum decks you feel achieve the idea of being a pendulum deck the best, or just what you find the most fun to play.

They manage to avoid the issue of having effects that could make them too powerful by being all normal monsters and having a consistent pendulum effect. This is to an extent, a bit of a copout in terms of design, but the deck really makes it work by setting up the extra deck for materials fast while also searching out scales. It also has a very healthy level range of 3-6 and due to Xyz monsters interactions with pendulum monsters, it forces you to either fully invest in what you do summon or not summon them in order to have Pendulums in your extra. They can also be mixed pretty well and overall make a very good pendulum engine that manages to avoid pushing things too far.',40,59,0,0,'4lsr4f'),(0,1464748331,'geminia999','r/leagueoflegends',0,'This place makes me feel like Riot does nothing right','This isn\'t necessarily something I even disagree with, but it\'s very easy to see the bias and see just what seems like blatant incompetence and lack of communication with the community.

I was pleasantly surprised when the host brought up the suffering of our food animals and asked his audience to reduce the amount of meat we buy from industrial agriculture.\n\nHe also said, however, that \"we don\'t need to go vegetarian\" but only need to be concerned with welfare and reduction.\n\nOriginal story: http://www.capradio.org/news/npr/story?storyid=480671964\n\nI sent this letter to the local station:\n\n***\n\nI told myself that in writing this letter, I should be unapologetic. What can I say? I am an apologetic person. I cannot help it. So let me start by acknowledging that your editorial comparing the death of Harambe to the suffering of our food animals reached many people, and lent support to a cause that I care deeply about. Your words created good in the world, and that is commendable. I hope that what I am about to say does not obscure my recognition of that fact.\n\nBut not only did your editorial fall flat in terms of the comparison you attempted to make, but it is reflective of a weak and immoral welfarist position, and it helped to reinforce a deep moral inconsistency held by much of our population.\n\nHarambe was pierced with metal projectiles at the end of a life where his every need was catered to. Harambe lived in a system that attempted to help him express his natural behaviors; his medical needs would have been attended to promptly, with appropriate anesthetic. His death, then, should not be a point of comparison to the tragic suffering of our industrial food animals, but rather a cause to reflect on the value of animal life itself.\n\nHarambe\'s death was still a tragedy, despite all of the welfare he was provided with. When you explicitly state that people do not \"need\" to go vegetarian, you strip away the most important lesson his death could have taught. Even if a chicken was not debeaked with a searing hot blade, even if he were not isolated from the sun, even if he did not live out his days overcrowded and suffocating, and even if his death were quick, brought about by a projectile through his skull, his death would STILL be a tragedy.\n\nThe welfare position that you profess is one that requires us to devalue the life of an animal. Suffering is important, but if you take suffering out of the equation, then the sentient being inside of a chicken\'s body is a mere inconvenience. The body is mine, to put into my own mouth, and the sentience inhabiting that body is nothing more than an inconvenience. His life was without meaning, and his death is of no note. The taste of chicken strips trumps his right to inhabit the body he was born in.\n\nHarambe did not suffer in overcrowded conditions. Nor do the pets my clients bring to me at the end of their lives, to be euthanized prior to the onset of suffering from their disease. These deaths are tragedies not because of the suffering that took place when they were alive, but because a being capable of fear and joy and suffering and pleasure stopped existing. A being who desired to live another day had his life taken from him. That is the tragedy.\n\nEgregious suffering of our food animals is unconscionable, and needs to end, but the tragedy of their death is not assuaged with the removal of suffering. We DO need to go vegetarian— and in fact, vegan— or we are still guilty of daily crimes against the entire life and being of an animal with as much right to life as Harambe, or our own pet cat.\n\nWelfarism is better than torture, but it is a crutch, and a wedge, that prevents people from realizing that sentient life has value, and it should not be taken for our own trivial purposes.\n\n***\n\nDo you have any thoughts? I hope you\'ll consider writing similar letters when you hear your local news expound a welfarist viewpoint towards animal lives!\n\n',0,0,0,0,'4mjcwu'),(0,1465107083,'MultiAli2','r/gameofthrones',0,'[EVERYTHING] Bran as a villain...','Watching the way Bran reacts to things, he seems really... villainous.\n\nThings that make him seem like a potential villain:\n\nHis treatment of Hodor even before we knew of his origin.

It ends up being a slog on attack just trying to force your way through the initial chokepoint and taking the temple itself, and on defense gets boring because it\'s very easy with the advantage you have.\n\nMy first major issue is the twin arches being the only way to the point. This just puts so much power in the defence being able to setup blockades, have ideal sniping and turret positions with a whole lot more area to work with than the attackers. This wouldn\'t be so bad itself because Hanamaru\'s start is similar to this (though I feel it does it much better), but then we get to the second point and it just feels oppressive to try and take it against any decent team. Torb turrets has so many places that can be placed so they attack the point without being in very much damage. The attackers are funneled down 3 very tight paths making it difficult to not be noticed. There is two very nice sniping positions up top and there\'s no way anyone is going to be able to just go straight down the center path.\n\nMaybe I\'m just really bad at this map on attack, but it just seems so much more in favour to the defence when compared to another similar layout in Hanamura\'s second point. One entrance down the center, two on the side (though in Hanamura\'s case one side path can only be done by some heros). Despite Hanamura\'s similar design, it seems so much easier to actually come from different angles and due to being so open makes it more difficult for the defence to hide from the opponent. I understand people seem to have issue with Hanamura\'s second part, but it just seems so much better designed then Anubis\' that I can\'t really see any points it has over Hanamura (outside of maybe the side path being only accesible by mobile heros, but that causes it to be a generally less watched area and makes it better for the attackers, plus it leads to two places).\n\nAm I just over reacting, or does anyone else feel this map has some major issues?

You can only use this effect of Alien Hijacker once per turn. When you perform a pendulum summon using this card as a scale, you can remove up to five A-counter from the field, you can then pendulum summon monsters from your opponent\'s face up extra deck equal to the amount of A-counters removed.\n\nMonster effect: When this card is Normal or special summoned, you can add one Alien monster from your graveyard to your hand except Alien Hijacker. You can only use this effect of alien Hijacker once per turn. (If a monster with an A-Counter battles an \"Alien\" monster, it loses 300 ATK and DEF for each A-Counter during damage calculation only.)\n\nAlien Meteorite\n\nLight Lv 4 Reptile Pendulum scale 2\n\nAtk 1000 Def 1900\n\nPendulum Effect: When this card is placed in the pendulum zone you can place one A-counter on any face up card on the field. You can only use this effect of Alien Meteorite once per turn. You can take control of an opponent\'s monster with an A-counter but it\'s effects are negated and is destroyed when this card leaves the field. You can only use this effect of Alien Meteorite once per turn.\n\nMonster effect: When this card is summoned, place up to 3 a-counters on face up cards on the field. (If a monster with an A-Counter battles an \"Alien\" monster, it loses 300 ATK and DEF for each A-Counter during damage calculation only.) If this card is destroyed, either by battle or by card effect, you may take control of a monster with an A-counter.\n\nThat\'s the basic idea behind what I had planned, the idea being since Aliens like to take control of other monsters, why not let them pendulum summon monsters from the opponent\'s pendulum pool as a form of mind control. The scales I set are mostly for getting a decent selection when doing that, while also being able to summon pretty much all of alien\'s important monsters outside of Ammonite since he\'s level 1 and wants to be normal summoned anyways. The other one I wanted a somewhat consistent way to take control of opponent\'s monsters, but I\'m not sure whether I went down the right approach and maybe made it a bit too powerful. I also kind of designed the pendulum effect so it could some form of non targetting removal, use it\'s effect, then bounce it with Gol\'gar to destroy it then set it again.\n\nAnyways, there it is.

HEr ult seems pretty good to me, but it doesn\'t kill by it self and is a lot easier to escape than something like Zarya, but it can be devastating and has strong area denial with out putting Mei in danger herself.\n\nThe thing is, if the wall is pretty much the major part of her kit, I don\'t see how it can be made better that it would allow her to be a more often pick in the meta without becoming too strong.\n\nI like her as a character, and while I\'ll never probably get to that competitive level or even follow the scene, I don\'t know how she could be tweaked into a more meta character without majorly changing her.\n\nOr maybe I\'m just ignorant and know nothing.',12,42,0,0,'4pvkeh'),(8,1466944943,'ClockOfTheLongNow','r/SquaredCircle',0,'What constitutes a \"clean pin\" or \"clean win?\"','I guess in the wake of the Reigns/Rollins match and subsequent suspension, I\'m not sure what people are basing a clean win on anymore.

As it is, I\'d assume that there would be something akin to the League system, where you have to purchase any hero you wish to permanently own, with a rotating free pool (probably around 4-5 heroes). I would still presume that hero swapping is allowed, but it would mean you would need to own the counter (or for them to be free currently for you to switch to them).\n\nSo under this presumption, the question of overpowered comes more into which heroes have the more niche counters, and less counters overall.

Coyote theme, let\'s  just go through why this episode was NOT a filler, but an integral part of Peridot\'s arc from *Beta* and *Earthlings*. \n\nEver since she took the spotlight, one of Peridot\'s main traits was her utilitarian measuring up of other gems\' value, with a STEMlord-ish overreliance of \"logic\" and \"objectivity\". Garnet serves no function, YD is objectively the best, Amethyst is defective, etc. In practice, this has led to her heavily relying on ableist attitudes.\n\nThis had the strongest consequences in *Too Far*, where she had to learn her first basic lesson in empathy, that just as she can feel smaller from being given the cold shoulder, and feel bigger from being happy,  likewise Amethyst\'s height isn\'t just an objective number either, but the way she feels about it. \n\nIn *Beta*, Peridot demonstrated that this new-found empathy still only extends to her friends. When Amethyst felt bad, she instantly defaulted to trying to cheer her up by mocking their enemies\' physical shortcomings, while also providing the context, that as a Kindergartner, she has a professional investment in judging gem quality. \n\n*The Kindergarten Kid* (the title referring to her profession), she had to learn that it\'s not just her friends who deserve empathy, but that NO ONE is simply just \"dumb\", they all have circumstances and limitations that are possible to understand and worthy of consideration. Just as it has been spelled out in Monster Reunion, corruption is straight-up mental disorder, as much as Amethyst\'s height is a physical disorder. But having a disorder is not the same thing as being worthless, or even \"dumb\".\n\nTLDR: Peridot learns not to be an ableist, but respect even those with a \"different\" mental processes.  \n\n',3,4,0,0,'4xccxe'),(0,1470999960,'meMidFUALL','r/aww',0,'Baby lemur in Thailand','',1,1,0,0,'4xcz8d'),(1,1471030284,'geminia999','r/Overwatch',0,'Have you got what you wanted from the Summer Boxes yet?','We\'re now about half way through the summer event so i figured I\'d ask people how they are doing so far in their loot, whether you got some cool stuff or if you have been lucky enough to get the one thing you want?\n\nAs for me personally, I\'ve probably opened up about 20-25 loot boxes just from leveling up (got prestige bonus).

I put her hand back on her leg and say nothing. She then leans over to show me her amazing tits. I complimented the doctor.\n\nAnd this is where it gets scary.\n\nShe proceeds to gesture over her shoulder to a man who I had spoken to already, sitting just 4 feet away, right across from me.\n\n> That\'s my husband. He\'s so great. He loves me so much. Do you know why?\n\nI shrug.\n\n> Because I can make him cum like no other.\n\nShe puts her hand inside my thigh and now I\'m torn. The guy\'s looking over at me and fucking a stranger\'s wife in a new social circle, people who are in my industry mind you, doesn\'t seem like a great idea, but *man* did it look like fun. So I decide I\'ll do nothing but use this opportunity to have some fun and practice.\n\n\"How do you do that?\"\n\n> I suck his cock so good.\n\nI am floored. This is not appropriate discussion. Her guy didn\'t hear her but had now turned away. I figure he knew what she was up to.\n\n\"You really have a dirty mouth.\"\n\n> Yes I\'m dirty. \n\n\"Then you should get in the shower.\"\n\n> Oh I love the shower. I get down on my knees and then he just cums all over me.\n\nShe gestured with her fingertips to simulate the rain of jizz. \n\nAt this point I honestly have no idea how to respond. My brain couldn\'t process the pornographic level of conversation that we had immediately reached. We didn\'t escalate, we strapped a fucking rocket to our backs. All with hubby right behind her. I decide it\'s a good idea to cool it off a bit.\n\n\"So how did you two meet?\"\n\nShe gave me some details, here are the highlights.\n\nTook her 2 years to convince the dude to marry her, she wore him down with breakfast in bed and blowjobs. To be fair that\'s a great offer.\n\nHe earns a very nice salary and had recently started his own business. Beta bucks all the way. She put it this way:\n\n> I do everything for him and he gets me whatever I want.\n\nBored and depressed by this guy\'s situation I ramp it back up.\n\n\"Everything for him?\"\n\n> Oh yes he gets all of this.\n\nShe half-stood to wave her arms at herself like a magician.\n\n\"*All* of that? Even this?\" I pinch her ass.\n\n> Oh especially that, I love it in there.\n\nMy drink is dry so I get up for another one and to wrap my brain around the insanity of this woman. I don\'t even think she was drunk. It was still very early. At the most she was 3 drinks in.\n\nWhile I\'m getting my next round she walks behind me, pinches my hip, and smiles her way into the bathroom. I contemplate following before my friend pulls me aside and advises me against fucking this guy\'s wife, for a multitude of reasons. He made sense and I let it slide.\n\nHe left with her soon after with a look of anger mixed with shame. Everyone else exchanged the \"poor guy\" remarks. For as successful as he was financially, and how hot his woman was physically, he had *zero* respect in the room because she was out of control.\n\n**Lessons:**\n\nIf you\'re girl is such a freak that she can\'t keep her sexual proclivities to herself for more than 3 minutes after meeting a total stranger, you\'re gonna have a bad time. Granted, your dick will get sucked (assuming she wasn\'t bullshitting and still puts out), but you will be publicly humiliated.\n\nNever get married. This has divorce rape graffitti\'d all over the walls. \n\nIf there are no consequences for her behavior then she will be emboldened and empowered to this point. This is sexual liberation at its ugly peak. \n\nYou want a lady in the street but a freak in the bed.',9,38,0,0,'51by8p'),(8,1473123525,'Generic_Lad','r/Coins4Sale',1,'[WTT/S] MASSIVE dealer\'s lot of foreign coins','[SOLD]\nhttp://imgur.com/a/N7hNy\n\nLooking to trade for bullion (or will consider unusual/ancient/medieval/Scottish coinage) or Google Wallet/PayPal \n\nYou get everything pictured in the pictures, the canvas bag is about 1/2 full of 2x2s, the majority of coins are priced, and the prices on the coins range from about 15 cents all the way up to $10 or so.

The coins tend to be European, but there are coins from the Americas, Asia, Australia and Africa mixed in there as well with dates that range from over 100 years old to relatively modern coins. The majority of it comes from an older collection, which looks to have maybe come from the 80s or 90s (so the prices listed on the coins may even be low on some coins), while I make no promises as to how accurate the identification is on the coins, they look to be pretty accurate to me.

I\'m not a great player, and perhaps not even a good one, but I knew I was better than a bunch of trolls and AfKers which lower level bronze is littered with.\n\nEither way, I don\'t know what changed, but I think I just stopped caring for a bit.  I placed at Silver 3, which felt right, but quickly dropped.  Lots of AfKs, lots of trolls, and I know a lot of it was the new system sorting itself out, but I got really frustrated when I finally hit Bronze 4 and said \"screw it, I\'m playing what makes sense.\"  So I played Xul a lot more, soaked things to death, and while I never carried any games (although my XP was through the roof each game), I knew I was at least making a positive impact.  Plus, I was quickly becoming the banner in nearly every game as things progressed, and I was keeping Fal and Kerr out of the mix often even while my team raged about having to play against KT.   It worked out.  \n\nQuickly, I started racking up wins.  At one point, I was about 15 games under .500, and I quickly evened that score.  Got out of Bronze quickly, and the personal rank adjustments started kicking in and giving me some bonus points.  On the rarer-than-typical win trades, I was still ending up +20, flew into Silver, and kept climbing.\n\nFor those who complain about the quality of play, I can tell you that it\'s around Silver 2/3 these days where players largely stop being idiots and start actually working together.  The quality of play markedly increases, and the number of trolls decrease significantly.  I\'m sure you think you get bad play in Gold, but spend some time in Bronze, seriously.\n\nOverall, though, it\'s made me a better player (especially since forcing yourself to do what\'s right early helps when everyone else is doing it later (i.e., don\'t always buy into \"stupid together\")) and made the game enjoyable again.  The system doesn\'t want you to progress too fast too quickly, as I started getting downward rank adjustments as fast as I got the upward ones in Bronze, and that might be the one demoralizing aspect of the game, when it\'s trying to tell you that you don\'t belong when you clearly do.  Maybe the second season adjustments will help in that.  But I know this is rambly and perhaps pointless, but I figured I\'d share nonetheless since we get a *lot* of high-level players discussing their ranks but not a lot from the lower tiers.  I\'ve got about 25 more wins than losses, my best ratio since I started playing a year or so ago, and I\'m kind of excited to see how I do in the next season.  I\'d like to hit Gold in this season, but I know I\'m stalling out a bit at Silver 1 and that\'s fine, as I really feel that this it where my skill level is.  Still, if you\'re a lower level noob like me, it might be worth figuring out a few characters you\'re good with and just doing the best you can with them, and you\'ll probably get back to where you belong pretty fast.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/WMhyKHr.png\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/8B90EPz.jpg',34,126,0,0,'51fao3'),(1,1473240984,'ineedfreedom','r/AskReddit',0,'Redditors that were the \"smart kid\" in school, what was the biggest drawback?','',6,6,0,0,'51kg5c'),(7,1473447695,'geminia999','r/stevenuniverse',0,'Fifteen Minutes is foreshadowing','So the song from Last one out of Beach City is Fifteen Minutes by Mike Krol (http://artemispanthar.tumblr.com/post/150144250972/mike-krol-fifteen-minutes) and listening to the lyrics it seems oddly fitting for the future of the show to an extent since we know something big is probably going to be coming from Homeworld soon (since they attempted to get Jasper off the planet, likely to save her from whatever they have planned).

It makes a bit more sense if it was just AIs, but we still have dead kids and we know that dead kids and animatronics tends to make ghosts, but it just doesn\'t seem fully supported right now.',3,7,0,0,'56f0ga'),(4,1475958018,'geminia999','r/fivenightsatfreddys',0,'The Purpose of the facility','So right now the facility is still a bit of a mystery of what exactly is going on. I just kind of want to grab all that we know so far and figure out what is going on.\n\nTo start, there is the main stated purpose of the facility, maintenance on the animatronics. This part as far as I can see does happen, but it\'s more a cover up for what is actually happening.\n\nThe second is the act of scooping and the kindnap feature. It seems to me that scooping is a feature essentially meant to get kids that are kidnapped out of the suits, otherwise I just don\'t really see a reason for there to be a scooper, let alone one that is somewhat of a secret. If such a purpose is true, it would also explain the encouragement in forms of shocking the animatronics as it would be a way to fully ensure that the kids are dead before being scooped. The only issue I have with this though is that the two animatronics we primarily shock are Ballora and Foxy, who neither of who seem like they could kidnap kids due to being quite thin, but who knows.\n\nLastly, there is the private room and the connection to the three houses from FNAF 4. This is an even more secret function of the facility and I\'m still not exactly sure what it means. It seems that Afton (as it is his room), is monitoring these kids either while they are being attacked by actual animatronics or the effects of gas leaks. It\'s only clear that he decided the need to monitor those kids, but I don\'t think it can really be used much in relationship to the rest of this game and is more to suggests FNAF 4 actually happened. There is then also the fact that the rest of the private room has more rooms attached to it that I\'m not really sure why they would be there outside of facilitating the need of the private ending game section.\n\nThat\'s the best I can get, essentially being a disposal facility for bodies that the animatronics abduct while also serving as Afton\'s base for monitoring the kids in 4 (which also makes me wonder if we have any clue as to who the kid in the plushtrap game is)',0,0,0,0,'56isvz'),(13,1475962976,'geminia999','r/fivenightsatfreddys',0,'Biggest issue with Afton being the player character theory','Motive for Purple guy\'s/ennard\'s actions\n\nIt seems right now that Sister location is set near FNAF 4 and thus before FNAF 2. This means that the main killing of children that Purple guy is known for would occur after the events that take place in sister location. If we then take the ending where you are possessed as true, if we are Afton it would mean that Ennard would be the ones killing children in the FNAF2.\n\nHowever, I really don\'t see how that would make much sense from Ennard\'s perspective. Ennard wants to be free mostly, killing people doesn\'t really fit with that, especially if Ennard where to be an AI (that seemingly doesn\'t like being used in child murder from the something evil comments). If it\'s the ghost of Afton\'s daughter, then I don\'t see how children would be the focus of the ghosts vengeance, especially when they are lured.\n\nReally, the only thing I could potentially guess is that as part of Ennard pretending to be Afton, it copied his tendency to kill kids, but that still feels a bit weak and doesn\'t really explain the situation of the springtrap, where why would an AI or ghost be afraid of ghosts?\n\nReally, it just seems likely that you are a generic character like the other games, who was unfortunate and became Ennard\'s husk who then escaped and likely tried to stay low.',3,15,0,0,'56j6bl'),(0,1475976981,'geminia999','r/Overwatch',0,'McCree\'s Deadeye ult achievement is the bane of my existence','The simple \"get four kills with this ult\" achievement for Mccree is impossible to get.

It was something about the way he moved, the combination of cat-like grace, confidence, and talent. Idk. I was in awe. I didn\'t get him though, he was gay and it was agonizing. It felt like the universe had played a cruel, sick joke on me. I liked him sexually because he exuded sexuality, but oddly enough I don\'t think I would\'ve taken him up on the offer to sleep with him had it arisen and he wasn\'t the object of my (sexual) fantasies - though, I do have them (it\'s always a creation of my mind who is the object). I would have dated him though, can\'t say that about anybody else.\n\nBecause I haven\'t been able to find anyone to make me feel that way since, I\'m starting to think I\'m graysexual. Everyone else just makes me feel indifferent - it\'s like looking at statues. This is getting to the point where I just don\'t know what to do about it.

They seem more than everyone else - like they have some sort of connection to the spiritual. They seem more \"real\" almost, yet also mystical/mysterious - like a dream. They know exactly what they\'re doing and why they\'re here. The regular people, are just kinda there. Just doing regular people things - nothing substantial - and they seem pretty content about it. There are also so many people on this planet. Most of them are inconsequential for lack of a less harsh word. It\'s very difficult to think that a creator would have that much investment in all of them. I imagine that we\'re part of some kind of \"Human/Earth Experiment\" and God/The Dev sends spirits down to... do something via interaction with the NPCs. Kind of like he did with Jesus, and how the fallen angels did before the flood. But, perhaps these spirits inhabiting human bodies are more newly created and treated differently than angels.

After 300+ hours of play, I\'m done. I loved Rocket League so much until online play just sapped the joy away from it until I decided enough was enough. My very first play online was a goal and from that moment I was hooked. I struggled to find my place as a semi-pro until I discovered doubles, and from that day forward that\'s all I\'d play. And I was good at it.\n\nSo I started playing ranked and found myself advancing nicely through the ranks until around Challenger 2-3. I could visibly see a deficit in my ability whenever I\'d get to C3, so I practiced, perfected technique. The new custom training tool was super helpful.   I started to consistently be the playmaker for my team. Often I outscored the other team. But even as I saw my skills increase, my MVP rate soar, my situational awareness develop, I couldn\'t move forward. Two divisions up, two back, day after day.\n\nI\'m not a ball hog. Saves and centers are my pride and joy. Teamwork makes the game great. That sensation of serving up the perfect pass is so satisfying. I\'d rather get a playmaker than a hat trick any day. I pay attention to my partner, read them and react, bail them out for mistakes and cash in on their successes. But I\'m in the minority there. \n\nAnd that\'s because the ranking system is absolutely broken. It only rewards players for winning. There\'s no individual recognition, for better or for worse. Why is it that I still slide down when a player misses 5 of my passes? Why do I fall when I make 6 saves and the other guy whiffs on 3? How can I lose a tier when I scored more than 3 players *combined* (this actually happened once)?  \n\nGame 5 of a 5-game losing streak featured a guy who was AFK for the first full minute, 2 goals were scored on us. I scored once while he was gone. He came back, and got mad that I hit a ball he considered his. I simply typed \"I thought you were back in goal\" and he called me idiot and proceeded to play for the other team. \n\nThe straw that broke my back was when, in the very next game, my partner disconnected early when it was 1-1 with 4 minutes to go. I put myself up 4-1 in 2 minutes. The other team got it together and in a 2v1 came back to win in OT. But that proved to me what I knew to be true: I\'m way better than the people at my level, and I\'ll never be able to advance. \n\nTo see all the effort and love you pour into a game result in zero progression, zero reward, nothing but constant frustration as childish players berate you, it just makes the game completely devoid of fun. Day in and day out, getting nowhere, it killed my love for the game. Lower ranks are just a cesspool of okay players who don\'t comprehend how to play with another person, don\'t understand basic formation and rotation, and fail to recognize their own mistakes.\n\nRL seriously needs some system that allows you to progress in division and rank without winning the game. \n\nAnd players who are completely toxic, play against their own teammates or quit midgame, these need to be banned for more than just a few minutes. How about a week or a month? \n\nWhether you read all this or not, I\'m glad I wrote it. I always feel it\'s important for a company to get real feedback.

Why is it that some brains are imaginative while others seem to have some kind of strange glass cage preventing them from thinking outside of the box? \n\nWhy are so many people\'s brains inefficient, wired to do things the hard way? Why can\'t other people just have efficient brains? How did this happen? How did the brain mutate *that* much without totally f-ing up social dynamics? \n\n_______________________________________________________\n\nThen, there are people who can\'t seem to exercise self-control or at least have a very low capacity for it. Why is this? Is their will to control themselves less? Or is the will there and the capacity *actually* just lower? So many people act like they just \"can\'t help\" doing stupid things. Why? What is the appeal of stupidity? Why is it so hard for people to control their bodies? Why is it so hard for people to control their emotions? Why do other people seem so easily tempted when temptation is a near non-factor in my life? Why do people place so much emphasis on feels? It makes no sense! People would rather do the feel-good thing than the smart or the right thing. People would rather hear the feel-good lie, than the truth. Why? The good feels, feel good, but not *that* good. \n\nWhy can\'t people just have a decent amount of control over themselves?\n\n_______________________________________________________\n\nThat brings me to the fact that I have a really hard time dealing with other people\'s flaws. They\'re just so intolerable. People\'s flaws make me not even want to talk to them. The thing is many people\'s flaws can be easily fixed, but they just don\'t recognize their flaws as flaws it seems. The only way I can deal with someone on an equal basis is if I have that veil of admiration on that blurs their flaws out. I can still see them, it just makes them less detrimental. But, most people simply aren\'t admirable. They\'re so normal, average, bleh. They\'re like toys that don\'t do anything. Real lame. Most people have no original personality, they\'re not interesting, they\'re not knowledgeable, they\'re not particularly talented, they\'re not noble, they have no spiritual element. They\'re just highly evolved apes. \n\nWhy are some people more ape than others?\n\n_______________________________________________________\n\nThat brings me to the final question; how can you stand to believe that all people are equal, \"just different\"? It\'s such a naive thing to believe that Enlightenment era lie. The sheer popularity of such a belief is unbelievable... or maybe it\'s not because it\'s a feel-good belief. Everyone knows that, in truth, all men are not created equal. We do not all possess equal value when we\'re born due to inherent traits and qualities of the mind and soul, we do not possess equal value while we live do to those traits and qualities, and we do not possess equal value when we die because of those traits and qualities. Some people are merely highly evolved apes, whereas others are creations of God/the higher power. Some people are players and the rest are just NPCs running on automatic. \n\nSo what makes benevolent slavery wrong? Why should there be democracy? Most people would be content under benevolent slavery (as long as it was under a different name) and most people in western society have simply been brainwashed and socialized into believing that democracy is the best when it\'s not. There are a number of other forms of government that would be more efficient.

I was told over and over again that it was a felony. Because it wasn\'t a felony, security detaining me was illegal unless it was \"immediately necessary to restore peace and order.\" I was on a dance floor. Peace had been restored. \n\nSorry this gets long, it\'s a long story. One that\'s very messed up. If you know anything, pass it along.\n  \n**About myself**. I\'m an American English teacher at a high school in Peru, and I\'m also a university student. I started studying a few years after most people did so I\'m older than most of the competition. I went up with a Peruvian delegation to represent the USA and paid my own way entirely. I\'d been prepping like crazy for HNMUN since October. \n\nSuffice it to say I consider myself a mature and responsible person. \n\nOn Saturday night during the Delegate Dance there was a fire alarm as I was walking back to my room to get something. I thought nothing of it, it was the 3rd alarm in a week at the hotel. I even helped people find the stairs and guide them down.\n\n30 minutes later, on the dance floor. **I get pulled out** (literally a guy on each arm) and taken to a back room where insults are hurled at me and I\'m pushed around before being shown pictures of me vaping in the hallway.\n\nI\'m told I \"intentionally set off the alarm by blowing my vapor at the sensor.\" The video just shows me walking and vaping normally until I go off screen. The alarm goes off a few seconds later, but not when I\'m doing what I do on camera. \n\nI\'m told I have **30 seconds** to decide whether to leave of my own free will or be arrested. I demand to speak to my head faculty advisor who is also a lawyer. They tried real hard to convince me otherwise. Threatened my whole team. I tried to leave to find my FA and got pushed back in and told to shut the fuck up.\n\nFA comes and so does the SG of the event. **SG tells me** if I don\'t cooperate with the hotel my whole delegation will be in trouble, banned from future conferences, etc.. I\'m stunned. I explain that this isn\'t evidence of anything: The alarm could have originated from anywhere, the timing was off, hell people been vaping all over the hotel (myself included) and this hasn\'t happened before.\n\nThey backed off the legal charges but still insisted that it was against hotel policy. Nothing in their documents or in their hotel says that vaping is considered smoking. No signs, nothing. \n\nTo spare the team I got my things and was escorted out of the hotel through the front lobby in front of hundreds of people. I was told if I returned I\'d be arrested for trespassing. Tossed out on the street.\n\nWorst of all, I wasn\'t allowed back in to finish the event. I was definitely in the top 5, probably top 3. Ended up empty handed. \n\nIf you\'re thinking about attending HNMUN someday, just know that the hotel and the event, of whom **you** are a client, shouldn\'t expect *anything* from these people. They don\'t give a shit about you. Your directors are decent people. Your committees will be fun. But no one will back you up if the hotel decides they don\'t like you. And that hotel is run like the movie Casino. I half expected Joe Pesci to come out and yell at me. I\'ve never been treated worse in my life, and I\'ve had some horrible ex-girlfriends. \n\nFuck HNMUN. I didn\'t set that off. The next day I heard somebody had smoked in the elevator. They probably couldn\'t catch the guy and security was under heat from it being their 3rd alarm in a week for no good reason. So they find a scapegoat.\n \nEven if there\'s a slim chance I did, it absolutely wasn\'t intentional. And it didn\'t justify the abusive and angry way I was treated. It *certainly* didn\'t call for the SG to threaten my entire team. He wouldn\'t promise me anything, so he made them all sweat the whole night thinking they might all be disqualified. 30 of my friends forced to suffer. \n\nIt\'s sad that during an event which is supposed to be about diplomacy and respect that you get backstabbed by your very own SG at the end.',5,15,0,0,'5v9bzg'),(1,1487886036,'braininajar8','r/pcmasterrace',0,'Questions about crossfire.','I have xfx rx 480 8b gpu and I would like to crossfire it, do I have to buy the exact same model or just a rx 480, also can I buy a 4gb instead of a 8 gb one, thanks.',5,7,0,0,'5vtbht'),(18,1487977235,'geminia999','r/stevenuniverse',0,'Seems like everyone is being quite negative recently, lets discuss some of our favourite things from seasons 3-5','Every time I come here now a days it seems like there is always a discussion about an aspect that they don\'t like or criticism of the show recently and its getting to be a bit of a downer.

I mean compare some first season episodes like Frybo, Onion Trade, Beach party, Island Adventure, etc. there were plenty of episodes where the humans of the show had conflicts that actually ended up involving gem matters. Yet ever since we\'ve entered season 3, there has basically been nothing that had any meaningful interaction between humans and gems and vice versa (biggest exception would probably be Buddy\'s book and last one out of beach city honestly). A lot of season 3 involved episodes just around beach city and the only gem related things that ever popped up were related to Steven\'s powers rather than anything else. Heck, the gems rarely make any meaningful appearances there either, why is the show getting more segmented rather than more unified between these halves?\n\nThis again leads me back to this episode where we finally have a human take proactive interest in the gems, and then it\'s entirely an episode between him and Steven. This even kind of contradicts the apparent message the episode gives because the gems don\'t seem to even do anything to even attempt to accept Ronaldo in the first place (Pearl doesn\'t even learn his name). I mean, we know Connie came over for lessons, but we can assume that nobody offered Ronaldo to tag along and start training as well (which they said he would need before he could go on a mission). Heck, would anyone have been disappointed if the conclusion of the episode involved trying to fight a gem beast and being way to in over his head or something along those lines, or if Ronaldo actually had some conversations with the gems to any extent? They say Ronaldo tries to start making it about himself as soon as he starts getting ignored, but no one seems to even try and do anything with him in the first place outside of Steven. We are 2 thirds of the way through what we know is confirmed (5 seasons) and the gems somehow seem even more distant in their interactions with Beach City than at the start of the series.\n\nI just don\'t get why the show is making these elements drift farther and farther apart when they really should be getting closer and closer. Right now all I can see to maybe rectify this is that the plan mentioned by Yellow Diamond in That will be all will involve beach city to be attacked or citizens kidnapped to end up bringing things back together. Though even a solution such as that could have issues as it feels like it might tread water on the Zoo arc we just had if they get kidnapped.\n\nI guess all I\'m trying to say is that I would really like if the show had some more humans besides Greg and Connie get involved into the adventure like Seasons 1 and 2 already managed to do and actually have Steven change the gems in their interactions with other humans instead of treating them like animals that need protecting.',9,11,0,0,'5w5btt'),(0,1488597774,'MultiAli2','r/askphilosophy',1,'We\'re living in a simulation and most people aren\'t people...','[removed]',3,15,0,0,'5xexap'),(2,1488662879,'ineedfreedom','r/ShitNordaboosSay',0,'Welcome to r/ShitNordaboosSay!','I would like to extend a warm welcome to everyone that has decided to stop here in r/ShitNordaboosSay.

It\'s been almost 2 years since I started it. \n\nThis runs contrary to the advice: \"Write every day.\" (WED) There are two components to this axiom and I\'m going to break them down, but first I want to address the problem that I had.\n\n**How WED is read**\n\nWhen I first started out I read the classic WED advice. So I tried to make it a point to write every day on my novel. It never lasted more than a week or two. I even felt guilty and dismayed, like I didn\'t have what it took to write a novel. It\'s not like I didn\'t have the time either: I\'ve accumulated hundreds of hours of Rocket League. \n\nBut that didn\'t mean I wasn\'t writing. I\'ve arrived at a different interpretation of WED that I\'d like to share. First...\n\n**Write**\n\nNote the lack of an object for this verb. All writing is writing when you treat it the same way. So whether it\'s an email, an article, or this very post, every word will be carefully considered and tailored to the reader. ~~I\'ll revise and edit it before I\'m done.~~ \n\nEven when you\'re not working on your project, if you\'re writing *something* regularly then you\'re on the right path. \n\nBut it\'s not just about upping that word count. The writing *process* is so much greater than that. It\'s researching, learning, reading, thinking, imagining, writing and editing. You may not even realize how the other activities you take part in shape your work, but they do. \n\nRepeating WED over and over makes us lose sight of these other aspects of the process that are, IMO, *more* important than the act of writing itself. \n\n**Every day**\n\nMost of us don\'t go to work 365 days a year. Why should writing be any different? \n\nThe intent of WED is to force writers to get to work. To be productive. Like going to the gym, it\'s easy to get sidetracked and miss months at a time. WED solves that. \n\nBut does it result in a better product? Certainly, any skill you work on daily will improve. Are the gains of WED worth the possible losses? Here, from my experience, I\'d say no.\n\n**The trade-off: Words for Knowledge**\n\nSomeone who follows WED will probably have put out far more than I have by now. But in doing so, they may have missed opportunities to expand their knowledge.\n\nTo illustrate: My book features terrorists who wish to achieve an agrarian reform. It also deals with water shortages.\n\nLast year I read two books discussing agrarian reform, one by complete accident (it was related to my career). Those ideas helped fuel my writing about my terrorists, making them more authentic and complex. If I had pounded out my novel, would they have the depth they do now?\n\nIn February I participated in a Model United Nations conference about terrorism. In preparation, I barely scratched my novel for 3 months. Now I know how radicalization works. I know how these groups operate and why. That is now a part of my story. If I had not taken time off the book, would my MC\'s storyline be able to take the reader down the path of radicalization? Could I make you sympathize with a terrorist? \n\nAnd just last week, I experienced a water shortage first hand. Peru is in Peril right now. My scenes were actually pretty close to reality. But I saw things I had never imagined. Now I can include that imagery in my book. \n\n**In conclusion**\n\nDon\'t *write* every day, **Be a Writer Every Day** \n\nLook for ways to broaden your knowledge regarding your writing. View everything you write as part of your job as a writer. Analyze your surroundings, even when you\'re just having drinks with friends on a Saturday night. Imagine how you\'d describe it or how you\'d transcribe the dialogue you had.\n\nDon\'t feel bad if you\'ve shirked your project for a while. It may be better for it. And you can return and discover that what you\'ve done and learned has fueled your engine for thousands of words to come.',11,27,0,0,'60ot53'),(0,1490128474,'braininajar8','r/Smite',0,'New player who played a lot of Dota 2 and LoL, what is a good support hero to play?','My friend convinced to play smite with him, hes pretty good I would ask him but i wanna show i know a bit about the game, im fairly experienced with smite too.

But, the fact of the matter is most women are hyper-emotional, less-intellectual, and and weak. Most women are easily overcome and easily out-done by male counterparts. They\'re easy to get to and easy to manipulate. They frequently require assistance. They are dull and superficial. They are everything men can claim they are. Most women really are most useful *and* more happy tending the home. They otherwise get in the way, make things more complicated than needed, and whine about nothing in the workplace. The only women who can live up to what feminism so desperately desires to be are NTJ/NTP women.\n\nI\'m disgusted by ideas like those of The Red Pill, but unfortunately, much of their analyses are true of most women and their disgusting tactics work on most women.

I only played about 5 games during the testfire, but the movement and design just felt a lot slower than the original. I know that this may partially be due to having no gear, but everything just felt sluggish from movement to even combat I guess. Then there is the map design. They seem to be going for an approach of much smaller maps and a spawn area the enemy can\'t reach. Overall, the maps we\'ve seen so far just feel so tiny, especially when you compare the two we got versus Walleye warehouse or Urchin Underpass. It just feels like there is no real room which is then not helped by having decently sized marts of the map being inaccessible to the enemy team. This makes it relatively uncontested territory making the maps even smaller. Like I do question how good exactly a mode like rainmaker would be on the maps we\'ve seen so far because they can\'t really put the goal too far away.\n\nAlso am not a huge fan of the new specials either. I think most of the specials from the first game where pretty great, but I just am feeling cautious about these new ones. I do feel like I\'d rather have the killer wail rather than it\'s replacement of some long range beam sniper thing that feels like it doesn\'t have great feedback. I miss the inkstrike. Overall it just feels seems like they are changing things up just to change things up rather than keeping what works (unless they just aren\'t showing some of the old ones yet).\n\nThere is also the lack of a gamepad. While I do understand this is a limitation of the hardware, it\'s still a huge loss for one of the best games to utilize it. Super jumping was a bit awkward and bringing up the map accidentally was a great way to get killed (something that will be less likely at times, but still will occasionally be an issue). And I\'m not sure you can access that info while dead or not.\n\nLastly, the game just looks a bit darker or washed out in comparison to the original. I love how bright the original is, but everything I\'ve seen of 2 seems like it\'s a lot darker. Maybe it\'s the lighting engine they are using this time around, but it feels really drab from what the original gave us.\n\nI understand that we really don\'t have enough info to judge anything substantially yet and I hope I am proven wrong, but I just feel like I\'m not really liking the design aspects they decided to show off to get us excited.',7,18,0,0,'63l4s3'),(5,1491411896,'braininajar8','r/EliteDangerous',0,'Terminal has no market.','I looked at this site https://eddb.io/commodity/27 and traveled 100 lys to get to it and sell marine equipment, but it has no market, the terminal is anderson terminal.',1,5,0,0,'63muty'),(19,1491562139,'ineedfreedom','r/TiADiscussion',0,'Social justice on porn blogs?!?','All I have basically ever used Tumblr as was as a porn site.

It\'s like after spending such a long period of time with such intense investment and no return (it was unrequited), I\'ve spent all my resources. It\'s just not possible. I have no more funds for this. There is no one god-like around and if there were, I don\'t know if I\'d even be able to *want* to pursue them.

To engage in a fight would require the sacrifice of weapons, health and time for rewards that are often just more weapons (often not even that great either) and some materials. Often times, combat never seemed to be something the game rewards you for doing.\n\nAdd this in with an okay combat system that often just requires walking up and spamming attack to succeed, there is not even a benefit of at least engaging combat to be part of the experience. There just is very little reward for confronting an encampment versus ignoring it. You stand to lose more than you will gain (give up good weapons for worse ones, give up health, give up rupees used to recoup losses)\n\nHonestly, the system itself reminds of the complaints that people have of Paper Mario\'s Sticker Star\'s battle system, where the only reward for doing battles is more stuff to do battles with. I understand that an experience system would be very different, but I do wish that there was a way the game could encourage some more diversity here, even if it was just through more variety of enemies or having them drop rupees and hearts (go into an encounter with low health under the hope of being able to get some health out of it, versus no chance).\n\nAs it is, combat ended up being very underutilized in this game for me as the combat was not really required for much else but more combat.

Even rotationally, when Xul is allowed to do his thing by a team and can soak multiple lanes, it doesn\'t seem to matter as much. And since Xul is not always the best at team fights, the transition from the laning/pushing phase seems a little weaker as a result. \n\nI don\'t think Xul has gotten a significant rework since I started playing him however long ago. The last big change I recall was a weakening of his skeleton warriors, but that didn\'t seem to hurt me when I was playing him as much as the general climate has now.

But, nothing about globalism seems heavenly to me. Globalism is inherently at odds with freedom and self-determination. Globalism is a cultural imperialist movement - one in which leftist ideologies impose their values first on all the Western and, as globalists hope, general world. It is \"Europeanization.\" But, what if I don\'t value that flavor of \"equality?\" What if I don\'t believe in collectivism? What if I don\'t want to support the poor? What if I want to pay fewer taxes? What if I believe in capital punishment? What if I don\'t care for multiculturalism? What if I don\'t believe in democracy? What if I reject the culture that sees western Europe as the end all be all model of societal amazingness completely? Why is it a one world government with Europe running the show in some way shape or form that everyone strives for in their utopian vision? What if I don\'t want to be Europe?\n\nGlobalism is neither the most efficient nor necessary means for America\'s wellbeing. With alternative/natural energy sources, hydroponics/aquaponics, 3D printing, etc... there will be little need for globalism on a trade basis. And, politically, why not allow for experimentation and self-determination. So, what if there\'s a dictator in Africa? So what if he has child soldiers? So what if he decapitates dissenters? Let those inhabitants choose the course of their history in the same way nearly all of the European nations did. If there is war in that region let it be so and if the dictator is especially cruel, let it be so as well. One day there will be a revolution, and if not at least it\'s a stable government. If a small Asian country chooses communism, that\'s unfortunate, but let them sort it out as they will.\n\n\nI see no need for this constant interventionism that Western nations are known for and it would become even more routine in a globalist society.\n\n\nTo go even further, why do we have to end world hunger? Why do we have to end world poverty? Why do we waste time caring about what other nations think? Why is there this idea that we have to \"heal the world\" before we can move forward? That\'s not even factual. We could terraform Mars all on our own. We could all be cyborgs on our own. We could leave the rest of the world in the dust, theoretically. Why not pluralism? Why not mind our own business? \n\nCould it be that ideas like globalism and leftist thought in general are generations of EXFX emphases? Whereas ideas like libertarianism, pluralism, isolationism, and capitalism are more IXTX generations? Possibly because EFs value cooperation, socialization, and \"everyone\" ideas more and ITs value independence/freedom, merit, and internal systems more? \n\nCould it also be the people who value \"cooperation\" in general and say things like \"we need people\", \"we\'re a team\", \"we\'re all in this together\", \"humans are social animals (as justification for forcing interaction)\", etc... believe these things *so strongly* because they lack personal ability? Are they so cooperation heavy because they\'re dependent on help in order to \"make it?\" Do those who value independence do so because they\'re more capable on their own? I think it might be so. In my experience (and from what I\'ve read here), many who hate group work (for example) hate it because it\'s a hindrance to their own achievement. Whereas, I imagine people who love group work love it because it lifts them up to higher than they would be on their own. For one type of person *collectivism* and \"everyone\" thought is an anchor pulling them down, yet for another type of person it\'s a life jacket. If that\'s an accurate \"two kinds of people\" dilemma, wouldn\'t two different societies for those two different peoples be more suitable for their contradictory styles of work and ultimately living (capitalism vs. socialism). \n\n\n\nJust some random thoughts.

If the Ferengi have a government, we haven\'t seen it.\n\n**The Grand Nagus**\n\nThe Nagus first comes to DS9 to conduct business negotiations with the Gamma Quadrant.  But why would he be negotiating trade deals instead of the treaties that would allow trade deals to be negotiated by Ferengi entrepreneurs?  Because he *is* a Ferengi entrepreneur, and that\'s all he is.  The vast majority of the time we see the Nagus going about his business, it is in fact business, and not politics.\n\n\"Nagus\" is a title given to the wealthiest Ferengi in a community.  Each village, town, and city has a Nagus.  The Grand Nagus is the Nagus of the entire planet.  In \"Little Green Men\", Nog mentions \"a globalized economy\" as one of the milestones of civilization.  It wasn\'t until the Ferengi had a global economy that comparisons of wealth across continents became feasible enough for Gint to be named Grand Nagus.\n\nOf course, the Nagus does have a tremendous amount of social power in Ferengi society, as well as tremendous resources, which allows him to have a great deal of influence in directing the society.  If Adam Smith is to be believed, power once flowed from wealth in human society as well.\n\n>The authority of riches, however, though great in every age of society, is perhaps greatest in the rudest age of society which admits of any considerable inequality of fortune. A Tartar chief, the increase of whose herds and stocks is sufficient to maintain a thousand men, cannot well employ that increase in any other way than in maintaining a thousand men.  The rude state of his society does not afford him any manufactured produce, any trinkets or baubles of any kind, for which he can exchange that part of his rude produce which is over and above his own consumption. The thousand men whom he thus maintains, depending entirely upon him for their subsistence, must both obey his orders in war, and submit to his jurisdiction in peace. He is necessarily both their general and their judge, and his chieftainship is the necessary effect of the superiority of his fortune.\n\n...\n\n>The judicial authority of such a sovereign, however, far from being a cause of expense, was for a long time a source of revenue to him. The persons who applied to him for justice were always willing to pay for it, and a present never failed to accompany a petition.\n\n...\n\n>The presents which they make him upon such occasions constitute the whole ordinary revenue, the whole of the emoluments which, except perhaps upon some very extraordinary emergencies, he derives from his dominion over them. When Agamemnon, in Homer, offers to Achilles for his friendship the sovereignty of seven Greek cities, the sole advantage which he mentions as likely to be derived from it was that the people would honour him with presents.\n\nLike the ancient human sovereigns, the Nagus only has the power which his wealth and influence affords him.  In human society, the wealth-power connection was eventually weakened by the development of ideas such as \"divine right\" or \"social contract\", that gave the state the power to tax and pass laws.  These ideas did not exist in Ferengi society until contact with the Federation.\n\nPart of Gint\'s fortune came from writing The Rules of Aquisition, and creating the FCA.\n\n**The Ferengi Commerce Authority**\n\n*\"The prince, like any other thief, will fear theft above all else.\" ~Holographic Leonardo Da Vinci*\n\nThe FCA, in its original form, had one power and one power only: to grant a Ferengi Business License.  The license guarantees that the holder will conduct their business in what the Ferengi consider to be an honorable manner, most importantly that they will keep contracts.  \n\nYou might assume that the \"Ferengi\" in \"Ferengi Commerce Authority\" refers to the species, but actually it\'s the other way around.  \"Ferengi\" essentially means \"person in good standing with the FCA.\"  By some historical accident, it came to refer to the entire species and homeworld, in much the same way that the human homeworld came to be called \"dirt\".\n\nRule of Acquisition 17 states, \"A contract is a contract is a contract... but only between Ferengi.\"  This is misunderstood to mean that Ferengi may cheat aliens of other species.  It is that, but it is also a warning that Ferengi may be cheated when doing business with someone not in good standing with the FCA.  The FCA is in effect a more comprehensive version of what humans call a \"credit rating agency.\"\n\nOver the centuries, they\'ve become so powerful and deeply entrenched in Ferengi society that they have started to overstep their authority in a big way.  One wonders if Gint realized what kind of power he was giving them when he made them the permanent executors of his Nagal estate, so that they had a voice in the rise of every Grand Nagus since him.  It remains to be seen how Grand Nagus Zek\'s own overstepping of his authority will affect the situation.\n',8,31,0,0,'6lgpbd'),(1,1499367081,'braininajar8','r/CrusaderKings',0,'What are some cool mods to enhance my ironman achievement hunt ?','I am going to play my first serious ironman game and I was curious if there are any mods that are ironman compatible that improve the experience.

I tried to put it out there earlier so I could have some responses by now, but I get the feeling that I made absolutely no sense and came off as a bit unhinged. So...\nWhen I dream of an ideal relationship, I feel like I desire a closeness that is not present in the modern world. I don\'t want the \"seperateness\" that I see between husbands and wives. I want oneness and complete engulfment. However, when I interact with men, I feel a sense of distance between myself and them and when men flirt with me it becomes even greater to the point where it\'s like they\'re some other thing. That distance is not there when I interact with women, things are much more comfortable with them - they\'re just nice to be around and easy to connect with. I think I observe this distance in other people\'s opposite sex relationships. I want the kind of \"connection\"/closeness that I feel with women with a man, but that doesn\'t seem to be a possibility.\n\n\nI think gender roles are in the way of my obtaining oneness and complete engulfment within a relationship; masculinity and men\'s social concern is a wall that is preventing me from connecting with any man. It sounds strange coming out of myself because I don\'t fashion myself an sjw or even on the left, but the distance between men and women even when they claim to be close just doesn\'t seem right to me - it feels nasty and it looks unfulfilling. They say that as a result of original sin, the relationship between men and women is off. I used to think it was crap because of how it was presented as Eve\'s side of the punishment - as if her relationship with Adam was that important. It sounds sexist to me. But, now, it certainly feels like that could\'ve been the case. The relationship dynamic norm seems to be totally one-sided to benefit \"straight\" men (who seem to be more homoerotic).\n\n\nKeep in mind that I am a person who likes to dote, so that influences a lot what I\'m about to suggest. Here I\'m going to whine about examples of closeness I see lacking in an attempt to explain the gist. Why don\'t husbands and wives share a wardrobe - why is there this split between who wears what? Why is it that a husband is not able to groom a wife, like apply makeup and do hair, etc... and she do likewise for him? Why is it that it\'s seen as \"cool\", \"natural\", or just the default when it can\'t happen? Why is it that male stylist (or generally people who cater to women - fashion designers, etc...) are typically gay when it seems like straight men should flock to that kind of thing? Why is it that the common passtime of watching sweaty men roll around on top of each other on television or partaking in it oneself is considered regular straight man activity when it\'s so gay?\n\n\nWhy does it seem that gay men would make better partners for women than the average straight man? It seems like gay men should be straight and straight men should be gay, but for some reason, that\'s not the case. Does this not seem backward to anyone else? Like, unnatural? Is it cultural? Is there some kind of niche group I need to join? Am I asking for something so out of the box that I need to join a fetish group or something?\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\nTl;dr: The dynamic between couples seems backward to me.

I\'ve only *very* rarely been able to make the friends that I\'ve actually wanted to make - friends with adequate social skills, who are at least average looking (not dressing dumb and of average attractiveness), who aren\'t anime-creeps, who are interesting, who have normal home lives and upbringing, who can have good conversation, and who don\'t stare at me weird. You know, friends who are a net positive in my life rather than a net negative; friends who don\'t either make me extremely uncomfortable or feel self-pity. All the other times, either I\'ve somehow accidentally made friends with socially stunted creeps from whom I\'ve then struggled to free myself or been on my own entirely. \n\nI\'ve only ever been able to make casual acquaintances and situational company with reasonable kinds of people. It\'s strange because, for all intents and purposes, I\'m a normal person of slightly above average attractiveness wearing socially acceptable clothing of correct fit, I speak proper American-English, I have a good home life, and I have a very laid back, go with the flow kind of personality in person. People, generally, tend not to actively dislike me or be uncomfortable around me. Though, I\'ve been told I do put off a kind of \"get away from me/leave me alone\" vibe (accompanied by RBF). \n\nIn middle school, when this all started happening, I\'ll admit, I was the kind of weirdo that I\'m trying to avoid (but never to the extent that these other kids were) and so I was kind of with them by default even though I didn\'t want to be. In high school, I was kind of a loser who was getting into loner territory, but not necessarily a weirdo, and I had a better time making reasonable friends. \n\nIn college, I\'ve managed to distance myself from all of that. I\'ve developed my social skills and personality to that of simply a chill, yet eccentric (in personality) student. I made friends that I liked and who liked me as well during my first year, but they started branching into large friend groups and I was unwilling to do that because I\'m not really interested in having a huge group of friends (and keep in mind, I\'m naturally very heavily introverted). So, I ended up being a loner by the end of that year. The second year, I made some friends who I also really liked, but the \"leader\" of that friend group was kind of needy and domineering. I didn\'t like that, so I ended up being alone. This year, I\'m the leader of a music club, I like all my exec staff except one (she\'s a weirdo with all the negative traits mentioned above and she\'s incompetent and dependent) - guess who the only one who wants to go beyond acquaintance level is?

People talk about \"the people\" like they\'re the holy spirit or something and it\'s the one idea that people can\'t/don\'t challenge and still be taken seriously; you at least have to pretend that you care about this \"the people\" nonsense if you want to make a point about anything. It\'s as if people don\'t realize this is man-made, \"enlightenment\" era mumbo jumbo used to force the rule/age of the middle class into play. People will even act as if the \"essence\" of the idea exists in the Bible or whatever holy text they\'re subscribing to when in nearly *all* cases, it\'s simply NOT there.  \n\n\n\"The people\" is spoken about as if it were some kind of perfect deity, but no one ever takes a moment to look at what \"the people\" actually are. \"The people\" are boring, mundane, irrational, and ignorant worker drones. The very people that came up with this idea of \"the people\" do not reflect what \"the people\" they\'re trying to \"liberate\" actually are. These **thinkers** who created this \"we the people\" deity had those like themselves (industrious, self-starting, rational, educated) in mind when they created it, not \"the [zombie] people\". They had the \"bourgeoisie\" (for lack of a better word) in mind when they conceptualized this magnificent, ruling concept of \"the people\". They thought everyone was like them - and they were gravely mistaken. \n\nEven the revolutions were not the actual \"people\'s\" will, they were the will of \"the people\" - the middle class. If there weren\'t these key players (members of the middle class) leading the revolution, these animalistic riots that the actual people have would\'ve been directionless, ineffective, and put down immediately. It was \"the people\" (middle class), manipulating the actual people (the zombies) for their own benefit. If the actual \"people\" had their way, they\'d waste their lives away having kids, eating, and playing with gadgets they entitled themselves to via the government. I don\'t trust lame strangers, my neighbors, or even my friends to vote for what\'s best for me, so why trust \"the people\" when they\'re only fleshly consumers at the end of the day. They do not think - they only feel - and they\'re very easily swayed by great advertising/marketing. \n\nYet, if you don\'t accept this idea that \"the people\" have some kind of cosmic, spiritual whatever, people act like you\'re \"evil\" or something. We\'ve had more successful systems of governance ignore the concept of \"the people\" for millennia and we\'ve got a myriad of systems we haven\'t tried yet, but people still act like this is just the bread and butter of things. Why?\n\nThen, there\'s this idea that \"the people\" (in today\'s sense) have that their \"rights *must* not be violated\".  Why mustn\'t they? Are they not aware that their rights do not exist as an actual thing? There\'s no cosmic consequence for a particular government not allowing them a particular \"right.\" Are they not aware that God (if/whichever they believe) did not distribute \"rights?\" Are they not aware that there is only legal consequence for not acknowledging \"rights\", and once that is no longer a factor, their \"rights\" don\'t exist? People shout, \"you must protect my rights\" and say it so adamantly that it\'s like they\'re performing an exorcism, but if a government or an agency doesn\'t believe in that right then, why do they pretend it exists? It looks ridiculous. It\'s not a right, it\'s a want and it makes no sense. \n\n\nThe only reason that \"the people\" (in today\'s sense) can maintain this kind of cultural power, is because they\'re allowed to. If one day the industrialists decided to remove the idea from their hearts and minds, they\'d be able to do it at the ring of mass communications. \"The people\" concept (meant for those very industrialists) has unfortunately emboldened the *actual* people.  \n\n\nI don\'t understand this \"the people\" and this my \"inalienable rights\" talk when taken to this religious kind of extreme. People don\'t even understand that this only exists within the confines of government, anymore. It\'s like someone trying to describe a new color to you - it just doesn\'t make sense to me. It\'s like a mental wall.

In general it seems to be agreed that this was not really much of a great feeling for anyone, the enemy team has to redo everything while Mercy can\'t help her team without fear of being picked off first (and that her healing would make it less likely she could get the most out of her Rez). So in general it would seem that the original was needed to be changed so as to have less.\n\nNow we move into Mercy 2.0, where you have Rez as a cool down ability and is reset on ult. Now the complaints shift to tempo rezzing, that she has it available for every major fight and that when she ults she can haveup to 4 rezes within 20 seconds (Rez, ult and use the refund to rez, then a rez 10 seconds and 20 later). Again, the general complaint seems to be that Mercy Rezzes too much and that this needs ti happen less. Seems consistent with the view of the reason to change the previous ult.\n\nBut now we move onto Mercy 2.1, Rez is now on a strict 30 second cool down and is no longer reset or shorten during ult. However, now apparently Mercy is now nerfed too harshly and she now can\'t rez enough apparently. This change seems to be pretty good to me as 30 seconds is still enough time that you can have a rez or maybe two per team fight. It also makes popping your ult proactively a lot more appealing as you don\'t need to worry about ensuring that youcan get the most out of the Rez boost and reset, now you can use your ult to help start a team fight instead of trying to time it right enough that you can get two or three rezes before you start helping your team at which point it may be too late (or too powerful). Having Rez on 30 really doesn\'t seem that unreasonable.\n\nIs this to say I think that this change is fine, not necessarily. I would think that maybe either the reset or a change of the cool down to 15 seconds (not both) could also work as well as applying a resource system of some sort (be it a resource like scrap or something else). There is still room for improvement, but this change seems like it addresses the issue people have with new mercy, that she rezzes too much yet it seems like the majority opinion is that this change is much too large.\n\nAm I just missing a part of the community that is being quiet about being okay with the changes, or is the general consensus is that this nerf is too much, in which case I have to ask what exactly do you want from Rez?',7,10,0,0,'74hetr'),(1,1507548558,'braininajar8','r/pcmasterrace',0,'I have no idea which of my 3 cables is my power cable.

Being that I live in Iceland (on a student visa), I decided to make a post that can help everyone en masse. \n\n\nTo begin, go here: https://utl.is/en\n\n\nDo NOT make any further plans before you read this thoroughly. If you‘re from the EEA/Nordic country/Switzerland, most of this stuff doesn‘t apply. Otherwise, go through this with a fine tooth comb (I can answer your questions about this, but please read first). The immigration directorate does not play games and doesn‘t really want you here, so do things right. CALL THEM if you have questions (they take forever to respond to e-mails, if they even do). Also, have plenty of money, way more than the required amount. The required amount changed literally months after I got here and I was almost fucked. So be well-prepared. And also, TRAVEL HERE DURING THE WINTER. \n\n\nWith that said, I want to clear up some misconceptions:\n\n\nDO NOT EXPECT ICELAND TO BE SOME MAGICAL FAIRY-TALE LAND WHERE ARE YOUR PROBLEMS GO AWAY. THERE ARE JUST AS MANY PROBLEMS HERE AS THERE ARE IN YOUR NATIVE COUNTRY (most likely the USA, from what I have seen). Be idealistic, yet also realistic. I might forget to list some issues, but here goes:\n\n\nIceland is expensive: I can‘t emphasize this enough. Expect to pay about $12-15 for a mediocre burger (with some fries for an extra $4). Like, $7-8 basic grocery items can cost $30ish. Rent for single rooms usually starts at about $800-900 a month. Apartments usually start at about $1,300 a month (with anywhere from a 1-3 month deposit on top of that). Wanna order something online? IF you can get it shipped here, shipping costs will be absurd. One thing Icelanders make a point to do when traveling overseas is buying clothes, precisely because they also charge up the ass for clothing as well. Alcohol, entertainment, you name it, it‘s pricey.  \n\n\nIceland has dark winters/harsh weather: It doesn‘t sound like much, but it can really take a toll on you. Seasonal affective disorder is kind of a thing here. People here drug themselves up every winter (we‘re talking from basically the end of October to mid-April). It can be hard as hell to get up in the morning in the winter, and hard as hell to get some sleep in the summer. Not to mention this wind, which can reach speeds of about 30-40 kph (about 18-25 mph).  \n\n\nBut free health care!: Non-EEA residents will have to be on Icelandic health insurance for six months. All immigrants, even European ones, will have to wait until they have been here for six months in order to get Icelandic healthcare. I know a New Zealander whose arm got fucked up RIGHT before he had reached the six-month mark. He has paid a fortune to get everything fixed. I, personally, am medicated for a condition. The medication will get progressively cheaper, but I have been on these meds for a couple of months and am currently paying a lot for them. \n\n\nBut liberal! But good politics!: The government in Iceland (like in much of the West right now), leans very right. The general populace leans about center-left, but many still do or believe things out of ignorant habit (Iceland is very isolated, so foreigners being here in a signifcant amount is a very new thing for the country). For example, if you‘re not white, expect to get greeted in English about 25% of the time you go into public. And yes, political corruption DOES exist here, as small as this country is. There was recently a huge kerfuffle about the government pardoning a child molester just so that he could work for them again. \n\n\nBut everyone speaks English!: Yes, your Icelandic friends might speak English to you, but that doesn‘t mean that every Icelander will be comfortable with it. Even the ones that are might not feel that they can express their true self in English. When it comes to education, some Master‘s and Doctorate‘s programs are offered in English, but most Bachelor‘s are offered in Icelandic. Some professors might let you submit stuff or take exams in English, but it really varies. As far as work, you can‘t expect to go much further than restaurant/low-level tourism jobs with just English. So YES, you DO need to learn Icelandic. Get to at least B1, but the further you go, the easier things become.  \n\n\nThis kind of became a wall of text, but I hope that it helped some people and I would be willing to answer questions regarding things I haven‘t already addressed.  :)\n',1,2,0,0,'75j0b2'),(1,1507789948,'Impacatus','r/AskReddit',0,'Redditors who\'ve experienced a news-worthy event, what\'s the worst reporting about you it saw?','',3,8,0,0,'75v7w8'),(32,1507848506,'geminia999','r/yugioh',0,'Is it time to lay off the Raid?

The people answering questions are locals who want to share the city they love with visitors. We get hundreds of questions a week, many of which are very similar questions. We\'ve made the [world-famous wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/Amsterdam/wiki/index) to answer the basic questions. Before you post, you should read the Essential Tourist Information. If it\'s obvious that you did not do this, you may be told to go back and read it. The more effort you put into your question, the more effort we will put into helping you.\n\n2. Because we live here, we probably don\'t know what the best hotels are. We can tell you about the neighborhoods and transport, but most of us don\'t see the insides of the hotels and hostels that tourists do. Sorry. Yes, we know that accommodation is expensive. Amsterdam is, per capita, one of the most touristy cities in the world. That drives prices up. There really isn\'t a secret \"cheap\" solution. Sorry.\n\n3. We know that many people come to /r/Amsterdam for information about the city\'s drug culture. Understand that this is just a tiny part of Amsterdam, so posts that treat Amsterdam like it\'s the Las Vegas of drugs sometimes get a negative response. Remember that normal people live here who aren\'t on holiday. We\'re happy to give you advice about coffeeshops and to discuss drug policy. You might also have success with the experts with our friends at /r/AmsterdamEnts. \n\n4. When it comes to drugs, we will not help you with things that are clearly illegal. Coffeeshops caught selling to minors get shut down and everyone loses their jobs; we are not going to help someone under 18 get into a coffeeshop. Smuggling marijuana out of the country is illegal, and authorities do indeed check at the airport and on the border; we will not help you try to outsmart them. Asking for hard drugs is illegal; we do not want /r/Amsterdam to turn into a marketplace for illegal drugs.\n\n5. Don\'t be rude. There is Dutch directness and there is rudeness.

This follows on to the next point:\n\n**Be on time.** If you are unable to attend your class, please DM your professor/student prior to your meeting.\n\n**Be comfortable and be positive.** By creating a positive learning environment with your professor/student, you will feel comfortable and engaged. As a student, you will become more open to actively participate in class and it will be more likely that you benefit from the session.\n\n##Guidelines to students\n\n* Come prepared. What do you want to improve at? What new skills would you like to learn? Is there anything the professor can review (vods)? Know your weaknesses: what do you struggle with?\n\n* You will choose a suitable professor below and send them a DM or reply on the comment. You will have to wait until they respond to confirm whether they will take you in or not. **Note:** If the professor does not reply to your DM, it is possible that his/her schedule is full. *Please respect the professors and do not spam them. Any reports will result in a ban.*\n\n* Have an open mind before going into the session. Take the advice that is given to you. Improvement takes time and you cannot rush it. The more effort and time you put in, the more profound results will be, so never give up!\n\n##Guidelines to professors\n\n* As applications roll in, you will accept players of your choosing. Co-ordinate with your student to choose the right time and length for your session.\n\n* **When your schedule is full**, please edit your post (by placing \"#FULL\" above your original comment) to say that you’re not longer taking new students. Please respond to every DM, even when your schedule is full.\n\n* With the format above, be sure to make clear of what coaching services that you will offer, i.e. general FPS practice, review replays/VoD\'s, etc.\n\n* We advise the coaches to organize a timetable with specific lessons on specific times. It is of great importance to work step by step. This will avoid overburdening your students with a demanding workload/too much information. Be sure to be prepared before starting the session.\n\n* Don’t forget to listen to your students. Your student might be struggling with X without you noticing it, which might makes it harder to progress.\n\n* Remember, you are a professor (albeit voluntarily)! You will be up to helping your students in almost any aspect of your area of expertise and making sure they understand it. And make sure to have fun in the process as well :)!\n\n \n\n*If you are a professor and you don\'t end up getting any students for this week, feel free to repost it for next week.*\n\n---\n\nReport any disrespectful professors or students [here](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FOverwatchUniversity).\n\nYou can use the same link to contact the moderators if you have any questions or suggestions.\n\nGood luck and have fun!\n',1,1,0,0,'76rilg'),(3,1508170250,'AutoModerator','r/halo',0,'Weekly REQkoning Thread','Hello everyone!\n\nWelcome to this week\'s Weekly REQkoning thread!\n\n  Manage to snag that elusive Nornfang in a Daily REQ?

Plus, it\'s hard to find relevant cases, as our system is pretty old and the search is not useful.\n\nMy program/script will generate a personalized set of discharge instructions based on the case. Here\'s how it should run:\n\nThe student enters their name and then selects what procedure they need to write a discharge for from a dropdown list. When they select the procedure, a bunch of options come up. Each option is an item on the discharge; the student will have the option to include or not include each one, and change some settings, as well as create their own unique settings. For example, they might have an \"intro\" option, and if they check the box, it will generate \"thank you for bringing (patient_name)\" into the hospital today.\" They could select from this message or another default message, or type their own unique intro (which they can then store and use again later.) \n\nThey\'ll also enter in the patient\'s name, species, and sex, and other information unique to the case-- student\'s name, contact number, etc. The appropriate section of the discharge instructions will be edited accordingly.\n\nIdeally, as each option is checked or unchecked, the end product will be dynamically written or deleted from the document, but that\'s not necessary. In the end, they can copy the output and paste it into our system.\n\nOKAY, that\'s what I want to do. Here\'s my idea on how to implement it:\n\n1) Find a good set of discharge instructions for a particular procedure.\n\n2) Convert the instructions to an XML file, with each section given descriptive tags. Variables such as patient name, gendered pronouns, etc, will be given unique phrases (which will later be edited by javascript using a find and replace.)\n\n3) All of the procedures converted to XML will be put in one big file, the \"default\" file.\n\n4) When a student opens the Discharginator Homepage (on our class site, so it will be password protected already and I won\'t have to worry about security), a form will ask for their unique ID.\n\n5) When the page gets the ID, it will check it against a document/database of some kind. IF it\'s new, I\'ll use PHP to copy the default.xml sheet and save the new copy under \"uniqueID.xml\" and load it up as a DOM. If the ID is already in the system, it will find that XML page and load it as a DOM.\n\n6.) After unique ID is entered, javascript will create a dropdown menu of all procedures using an include file.\n\n7.0) When a student selects a procedure, javascript will check to see if that procedure has any \"personalized\" tags; if not, it will load the default tags, and if so, it will load the personalized tags.\n\n7.1) If the procedure has only one tag of a given name, a dropdown menu beside that tagname will have options of \"include? yes/no\" and \"personalize\" on the HTML page. IF it has multiple tags, those will be interpreted as multiple options, and a dropdown list including each tag\'s attribute will show up, along with the options.\n\n7.2) When the student clicks \"personalize,\" javascript and/or php (??) will create a new node with the same tagname, but a different attribute (which the student can enter) and when they enter their personalized text, it will be saved in that element\'s text node. These changes will be saved via PHP to their personal XML document so they can use them in the future.\n\nI hope this will be fully extensible, but I\'m not sure-- meaning, if I want to add new tags to a procedure later, I can add them without breaking anything, and same for adding entirely new procedures. To accomplish this, I would have to check the personalized XML file against the default and if I find new tags in the default, they\'ll have to be added to the personalized page.\n\n*TL;DR:* I want to let students generate text from XML data and also customize their XML data, and to do this I want to use XML DOM, javascript, and PHP.\n\nSorry this is so long... but I\'d really appreciate anyone\'s thoughts on whether these are the right tools, whether there are easier ways to accomplish my goals, and whether this is likely to be too much for a complete n00b to accomplish.

After reading my post, if you have a career that fits... would you mind talking to me about it?','Okay, I know this is a bit awkward and really selfish, but I\'m getting desperate for some sliver of hope. Let me start with an explanation of where I am. If you just want to know what I\'m looking for, skip to the section that starts in bold below.\n\nSo, I hate my life. I\'m not sure what went wrong, exactly. One big problem is I have always been terrified to make big life decisions for myself. That will factor in later. Thanks to pressure from parents, I\'ve worked (summers) since I was about 15 (agriculture, I lived out in the boonies). I always hated it with a passion. I spent all of my spare time pursuing escapism (books, daydreaming, computer games if I was allowed.) I was always encouraged to do well in school so that I could get into college. Hell if I knew why I wanted to go to college, but it was made clear that I was expected to go. I also always played sports, year-round, and so I never got home before 6 or so after school, and never really explored my interests. By the time senior year came around, all I knew about life was that I didn\'t like working in the corn fields.\n\nSo, when it came time to apply for colleges, I was shocked when the application for the local University asked questions like: what career do you want to pursue? What college are you applying to? What will your major be?\n\nUm... I guess I thought you just took classes until you found what you liked. Okay, so I decided to just ask the closest person what they thought, and they said \"why not be a veterinarian? You really like animals.\" I didn\'t really want to be a veterinarian, particularly, but you know-- I didn\'t particularly have *anything* in mind, so I figured why not. So I enrolled in biology, and joined the vet med clubs and stuff, and started building a resume. In the back of my mind, I assumed I would eventually find something I liked and change majors, but of course I was scared to change majors and waste all that time/money/effort that I\'d already put into it. So I just kept going. (At no point did I actually work at a vet clinic; I thought I was clever, and instead, to gain \"animal experience,\" I worked as a caretaker at a lab animal facility on campus, which paid much better and seemed less stressful. The idea of working at a clinic seemed even less appealing to me.)\n\nSo then I got into vet school. I was immediately faced with the horror of spending every day with 130 students who wanted nothing more in their entire lives than to be a vet. It was just the greatest thing! In the face of this, my general lack of enthusiasm for the career slowly grew into contempt for it. It didnt help that people\'s general practice experiences gave them a huge leg up on me-- the very first week of class, I was shocked when a teacher decided to present a case to us, and as soon as he read the signalment (breed, age, sex), people were already laughing and shouting out the answer. And they were right, but I had never even heard of the thing they were shouting and had no idea how you could even get there from the information we had.\n\nBut it seemed too late to turn back. Anyway, I\'m good at school and also figured, \"oh well. I\'ll catch up.\" So I went through 3 years of classes, in the process getting incredibly addicted to reddit (obviously not on this account), since it allowed me to escape from the agony of thinking about vet school. I would get home from class, turn on the computer, and stay on it until it was time to leave for class the next day. I would see spots, get dizzy, have heart palpitations, etc, and be completely unable to focus, and then do it all again. I never got into any real academic difficulties, but I never stored anything in my long term memory, either.\n\nThere were some things that I really enjoyed during this time. I write articles for our school newsletter. I came up with and created a system for students to create \"homework sheets\" since I figured, like me, a lot of students probably learned better when faced with questions instead of just re-reading notes. It was actually really intense-- I got 20+ volunteers, and I made a schedule so that every lecture was covered by one student. I sent reminders before every class (eventually I learned to automate it), proofread everything (I love proofreading!), then printed the sheets and brought them to the professor to discuss whether the depth was appropriate and whether they were correct. I made a Google Sites page that is actually pretty snappy, even though I recognize that it took no talent, and posted all of the sheets and answer keys online. I even arranged for volunteers to cook food for the other volunteers. I became a webmaster for a small club, and learned HTML and CSS to make a page for us. I then wrote an 80 page binder (with a quick guide/reference, a history of computers and the internet, and more detailed sections on HTMl and CSS) to help other clubs maintain their own web pages, since most clubs are small and the subset of people who are interested in being webmasters and are also interested in a particular veterinary specialty is not huge.\n\nBut mostly, it\'s been hell. And now I\'m in my 4th year, where we enter clinics. No, this is not a relief. I like dealing with ideas, and I like creating infrastructures that help other people do things. But I hate investing time and effort into a single action and then repeating that action over and over. \n\nEvery day, my only goal is to get done with the day. I feel like I can\'t possibly quit-- I\'m over 100 grand in debt, and quitting would make it harder to get any job, even outside of veterinary school.\n\nSo, I\'ve realized it\'s time to face reality. I am not going to last very long as a veterinarian. I need to either quit now and pursue another job, or at least know that there is a career out there that I will enjoy that I can pursue if I just stick with vet stuff long enough to pay back the loans.\n\nOkay, so anyway... that\'s where I am. **Here\'s a little about what I enjoy and what I want out of a job.**\n\nFirst, money is not important. I can be very happy with nothing but a nearby library and my guitar. I am single, and am not in a hurry to start a family.\n\nFree time, on the other hand, is important. My interests change rapidly, and I am really driven to pursue them; I find it hard to imagine that any job could ever be front and center for me every day of my life. However, if I could manage to work only 30 hours a week or something, I would have plenty of time to pursue my personal projects, and could approach my work with more enthusiasm.\n\nI\'d love to be able to contribute personal projects to the workplace-- for example, if I can build something out of materials or program something (I don\'t know programming yet, but am really interested in learning) and use it to make everyone\'s work easier, I would do it. (Helping my classmates/co-workers is one of the few things that I truly enjoy in any job; I am always happy to buy a dish rack for the break room, fix broken equipment, find better ways to do things, etc.)\n\nI love finding ways to break things. I never finished a stage of Doom 2 in under an hour, because I was obsessively clicking every inch of the wall. I almost never play any game the right way-- instead I try to find bugs or ways to make the AI do new or unexpected things.\n\nI enjoy the frustration/reward of struggling with math problems. Granted, I only took whatever the highest level of calc is in college, so I can\'t say I\'m actually good at math (I got an A+ without extra credit though!) but even so, there is always a problem somewhere that just won\'t work out, and it drives you crazy-- but then when you get it, it\'s the best feeling in the world, right?\n\nI love public speaking. I enjoy finding flaws in things-- papers, games, whatever. And I don\'t like the idea of an office.\n\nHoly cow, no one is ever going to read this. Sadly, if I delete it all now, I probably won\'t get the stamina to post a briefer version later. Anyway-- for the 1 person who actually reads this wall of text, do you know of a job that I am a fit for, and can you or someone you know talk to me about what that job is like for them?\n\n',16,39,0,0,'dotzt'),(5,1286989756,'iwillnotgetaddicted','r/reddit.com',0,'The Green party candidate for governor was arrested last night for trying to enter the building where the debate was held.

On the other hand, when a game is played among strangers who will never meet each other again, rationality is probably the most valuable asset.\n \nI don\'t know how fast behavioral changes occur among generations of people or how much these three traits are influenced by societal norms, but if the answers are either \"pretty fast\" or \"quite a bit,\" then we can make certain predictions about rural vs urban communities (with a few assumptions.) My assumptions are that people in urban communities tend not to live in the same neighborhood for long periods of time, and that their social circle tends to change quite a bit over time and day to day, while people in rural communities may have roots going back for generations in the same neighborhoods.\n \nSo, if all of these assumptions and theoreticals hold true, what are the predictions?\nSmall/rural communities: we\'d expect people to be quick to trust, especially among ingroups; we\'d expect hospitality, generosity, \"shirt-off-their-back\" kinds of behavior. We\'d also expect short tempers and long-held grudges.\nLarge/urban communities: We\'d expect a higher degree of skepticism, first of all. Instead of believing by default, they\'d dismiss by default, making them less susceptible to stupid email scams and less likely to forward dubious chain letters or facebook posts. We\'d also expect them to be more rational, thinking less about what is \"right\" and \"wrong\" and instead focusing on what will have the greatest personal benefit for them (which is usually the same thing that benefits society the most, of course-- society has been carefully crafted such that this is likely to be the case, or it wouldn\'t function.)\n \nThe reason I think this is kind of a neat idea is that it explains some of the differences between urban and rural folks without resorting to some of the more emotionally divisive explanations, such as lack of education in rural communities or immorality in the big cities.',3,4,0,0,'e5ses'),(2,1290144914,'iwillnotgetaddicted','r/math',1,'Question on applied statistics/analysis, based on a spreadsheet to keep track of sports betting.','Let me know if this is better suited to \"CasualMath\" or some other reddit; I wasn\'t really sure.\n\nHere\'s the setup: I and 3 friends rank every NFL game each week. Say there are 16 games, we pick a winner for each game and assign each game a point value. If the team we pick wins, we get that number of points (nothing happens if we lose.) Highest points at the end of the week gets all the money.\n\nI created a google docs spreadsheet that does all the math for us-- we just put in our ranks, and then put a \"W\" or \"L\" next to each game, and it keeps track of our score, how much we can possible score if we win the rest of our games, and when someone is eliminated.\n\nI realized that someone can be mathematically eliminated even *before* their \"total possible points left (if their remaining picks ALL win) added to their current score are less than someone else\'s current score. This can happen, for example, if they\'ve chosen the same winners for all remaining games, but have put fewer total points on those games.\n\nSo here\'s the part that is interesting, and I mean this from a purely mathematical standpoint (I\'m not trying to gain an advantage; I will be sharing this link with them if I get any responses.) In order to make the calculations of when a person is eliminated this way, I separated it into two steps. The first step is to calculate, for each unplayed game, what any one player will score against any other player if the first player wins all remaining games. (The second step is to compare those numbers to current scores.) So for example, if there\'s one game left, player A put 10 points on the same team that player B but 8 points on, the cell for \"Player A vs Player B\" will read \"+2\" while Player B vs Player A will read \"-2.\" I wrote these all out and left them visible instead of wrapping the formula all into one cell.\n\nWhat I am wondering is, does that intermediate step tell us anything?\n\nIt seems like it could be used to gain an advantage (if everyone is able to submit their picks at any time, instead of submitting them all, say, in an envelope, only to be opened when everyone is finished.) Again, if I get even a single useful response I will immediately share this link with all the other players, I\'m just interested in the puzzle.\n\nWould it be to your advantage, for example, to try to maximize your \"You vs Player x\" scores? I don\'t think this is the case, because this basically means betting against the odds for all games (assuming the other players pick with the odds) and, if the odds mean anything, this is likely to lead to a loss.\n\nShould you try to balance your \"pts vs\" evenly against all players, instead of stacking up against one? Or perhaps should you stack up against 2 players and let the other get by, gambling that this will win you 50% of games vs the 25% you might expect otherwise? (Of course this is jumping the gun, as it assumes that maximizing \"pts vs\" somehow increases your odds of winning, an assumption that I don\'t accept, but don\'t even know how to evaluate.)\n\nI\'m not even sure these points are meaningful in any way. Remember, the problem isn\'t as simple as if we were just rolling a die, because the games don\'t have an even probability; most of the time, the team that people bet for is a better team and has a better probability of winning.\n\nSo what do these numbers tell us, if anything?

Maybe there\'s a whole new set of IP addresses and DNS servers, and maybe a whole new protocol besides IP.

I have no programming knowledge. Looking for advice on time-effective ways to make this program happen. (Do it for the kitties!)','Okay, here\'s my idea. I want to use up-to-date information associated with veterinary diseases to create a free, open-source program to distribute or run online.\n\nThe way it would work is you would hit \"new appointment.\" The computer would randomly select a disease to give you (eventually, the incidence of each disease may change by location to reflect reality, or you may wish to set it to \"most common only\" or \"zebras only\" (meaning rare diseases-- this might simulate a referral hospital. But that\'s down the road)). Anyway, it doesn\'t tell you the disease. Instead, each disease is associated with a number of clinical signs and other factors. But here\'s the thing: instead of having pre-written cases with all the classical signs, I\'d like to make it more realistic and challenging. So, I\'ll input realistic histographs of clinical signs noted by owners for every disease, and the computer will come up with the presenting complaint based on this. \n\nSo, for example, the computer picks \"Cushing\'s disease.\" Dogs with Cushing\'s may present with like a bajillion signs, and some are more common than others. For example, nearly all Cushing\'s dogs drink and pee a lot. Many have normal to increased appetite. A small percentage of them have mineralization of the skin, called calcinosis cutis. There are tons of other signs. I would associate each clinical sign with some realistic incidence as reported by owners from the literature, and the computer would generate the case based on each of those values.\n\nThe next step would be for the user to select from a huge range of tools (bloodwork/tests, history, PE, etc) to pursue diagnostics. This part would work the same way-- you can literally pick any test in the hospital, and get back a realistic value. Each disease is associated with certain abnormalities-- again based on a histograph-- and if your test is irrelevant to this disease, you\'ll get a random value that, 95% of the time, will fall within the normal 95% confidence range for that value. You can ask questions of the owner-- \"have you traveled lately?\" and again, if travel is necessary for this disease (say it\'s a disease only found in South Africa) then they likely will say \"yes\" but if not, they\'ll generate a random answer like \"a year ago i visited my parents 3 hours from here.\"\n\nWhen they diagnose the disease, there would be a little discussion about the disease and some internet links. In addition, I would want everyone to be able to view the histographs for each disease, in case they question my numbers or accuracy; they\'d be encouraged to correct things or add things (or more likely, send me their corrections.) I\'d require a journal citation or a letter from a DVM or PhD or something before I would accept their change.\n\nI could get fancy with this too, eventually-- eg, associating a price with each diagnostic test, and having owners who are only willing to pay certain amounts of money. I could add treatments the same way-- eg, even the best treatment is only effective x% of the time, so the user must decide whether they\'ve misdiagnosed when the animal doesn\'t improve, or whether to continue treatment. I could even go all crazy and get in touch with business friends to add some kind of financial component to it-- maybe starting out you have some debt, and you don\'t have any fancy machines, but eventually you can build up your practice.\n\nThat is getting pretty crazy, but for starters I just want to know the fastest/most effective way to get this thing started. I would like to get some little test version going with 5-10 diseases and a handful of tests, and add from there.\n\nFirst question: Any advice on a programming/scripting language to learn/use for this?

Anyway, lately I\'ve been bothered by some of Stewart\'s coverage of the Right (including media.) He constantly hammers away at Fox in particular for being fear-mongering and blowing things out of proportion. Now, don\'t get me wrong, Fox *does* do these things, and I think Fox is a terribly biased and outright dishonest organization. However, Stewart, in going after Fox, often seems to be inventing controversy or blowing things out of proportion. I feel like, since Fox is the bad guy, we are willing to accept any criticism without critical thinking, becoming just an echo-chamber for the good guys instead of considering what is accurate and what is not.\n\nOne example is with the J.Crew fingerpainting ad: Stewart makes it sound like the Media is hysterical about this ad. He calls it Toemageddon 2011, making fun of the overreacytion. He plays a bunch of clips to illustrate. The thing is, when I listen to his clips, none of them seem hysterical to me. Look, I think the J.Crew ad was fine, of course, but in this case it really is a fact that a lot of people (perhaps stupid, homophobic people, but nonetheless people) would find this weird/questionable. That makes the issue newsworthy, if only barely. And the coverage of this incident really seems pretty fair-- with maybe one or two exceptions (the Family Center people and the Media Center people, who of course are crazy), all of the analysts (from actual news networks) simply say \"some people are upset.\"  Yes, there are probably bigger news items, but Toemageddon? Really?\n\nNow, if this were one of those Fox tactics with the echo-chamber, where one Fox commentator states an opinion and then all the others cover it as \"some people say\" or \"there are reports that\"... then I would agree. But in this case, there really is a (stupid) controversy, and these news agencies are reporting on it.\n\nThe point is, I feel like Stewart manufactured a controversy in order to report on it, just like Fox does.\n\nI feel like this a lot-- like, when Stewart and his news team are looking for things to go after, it\'s like they listen for a news item that could potentially be blown out of proportion by the right, and then they take any comment on that news item as someone blowing it out of proportion... to the point where Stewart himself if the hysterical one.\n\nObviously Stewart is comedy, I just feel like it\'s pointed comedy, and I\'m starting to think he\'s off the mark more and more.\n\nSorry, I wanted to find more examples, but I don\'t keep careful track of these in my head and have to run.

Their official help page [here](http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?docname=c01673672&tmp_task=solveCategory&lc=en&dlc=en&cc=us&site=null&lang=en&product=3837410&key=null#N506) doesn\'t cover this exact pattern, but the closest matches also point to scanner errors (but it says I should be able to print normally, and I cannot-- I just get a message that the door is open.)\n\nI\'m not sure I can encourage anyone to break open their deskjets to go looking for the part... but on the off chance someone else has had this issue or has a junk HP 4435 (really, this model with no ink probably qualifies as \"junked\" considering the price of ink)... thanks for any input you can offer.',1,2,0,0,'hy9on'),(1,1308442274,'iwillnotgetaddicted','r/Android',0,'Samsung Captivate users: YSK that you can upgrade to Froyo (without rooting) at any time.','I\'m guessing anyone into their phones and nerdy enough to be subscribed to reddit/r/android already knew this, but then I didn\'t until today.

(long post, sorry.)','Sorry, no before/after pictures; it\'s not a dramatic physical change anyway! That\'s not the point...\n\nI started lifting about 3 months ago, on the SL 5x5 program. I was trying to look good for an event that was about a month away. r/Fitness wasn\'t especially supportive, but one member did point me to SL5x5. It sounded okay.\n\nHere\'s the thing: I never go in the weight room. I\'ve been in shape most of my life, from basketball, running, and hitting some of the equipment in the hallways at the rec center. But I\'ve always been intimidated by \"guy\" guys-- frat guys, jocks, gym rats, etc. I don\'t know why-- I\'ve always imagined them brimming with confidence, having meaningful social lives with deep connections to many friends (don\'t ask, I don\'t know why I had these notions), and above all, being hugely judgmental of everyone who wasn\'t in their group of friends. Meanwhile, I\'ve always had a bit of a self-esteem issue.\n\nReading people\'s comments on r/fitness motivated me to get to the gym, but also showed me something else: for the first time, I got to see the other side of those gym rats. A lot of them are friggin\' reddit nerds, for christ\'s sake. But also, a lot of them are nervous about being in the gym, and a lot of them think anyone who is judgmental is an idiot who doesn\'t belong there. \n\nNow when I go in, I still feel like there must be someone judging me, but when I think of that, I also know this: if that person made his views known, there would probably be 5 other people telling him to STFU. Mostly, I realize most everyone in there is just lifting, and they don\'t care what I\'m doing.\n\nFor such a small thing, this has had a huge impact on my life in just a small amount of time. First, one small thing: I\'ve become a better basketball player than ever before. It\'s not because I\'ve gotten stronger, it\'s the mental shift. I\'m not bad at bball, but my style of play has always been really timid. I never ask for the ball. If I get it, I can usually score inside, but I\'m always afraid I\'ll screw up, and that\'s especially damning if I called for it in the first place, so instead I post up and think \"I\'m open, don\'t pass it to me.\" I never shoot outside, even though I have a good shot; if I miss, everyone will be mad at me for taking the shot.\n\nAnyway, that small mental shift that r/fitness gave me has, in this short time, made a huge difference. I\'ve been playing ball 2-3x a week for 3 years in the same gym, and never met anyone. In the past 2 weeks, I\'ve become friends with a handful of regulars who now pick me up if I walk into the gym and they\'re getting a team together. That never happened before.\n\nThis also factors into other areas of my life. I have this problem where if I screw up in front of people, I feel like it\'s an incredibly overwhelming task to face them again. This has actually led to some huge problems in my studies-- I\'m a veterinary student, and in clinics we have to work closely with classmates, interns, and residents. Last year, at one point I literally didn\'t show up one day to clinics because I didn\'t think I could face my classmates and their judging me. It\'s stupid, and I failed the rotation because of it.\n\nWell, that too has changed. Not like, black/white, night/day change-- it\'s still a problem-- but the transformation that started on r/fitness and continues each time I hit the gym or the basketball court is allowing me to have a much greater amount of self-confidence in every area of my life. And if you weren\'t aware, self-confidence is hugely beneficial, well out of proportion to what I previously suspected.\n\nAnyway, I feel silly crediting a forum about working out for such a drastic change in my life, but there it is-- I think a lot of my recent transformation has been thanks to you guys. So, thank you r/fitness for making my life better in a hundred big and small ways.',1,1,0,0,'i4o2k'),(17,1308629913,'iwillnotgetaddicted','r/RedditThroughHistory',0,'(May 3, 1970)This is bullshit... soldiers on our campus, shooting tear gas for a PEACEFUL PROTEST.

I can\'t seem to do it through any \"achievements\" menu, but here it is on the community blotter, by date. Too bad they don\'t link up to the achievements page; if I want to glance at what these things are, I have to open another window and switch back and forth to look them up.\n\nDon\'t get me wrong; none of these things takes away from the gameplay or the ease of acquiring new, great content, I was just surprised how often I am frustrated by the interface of the heralded Steam client.',5,10,0,0,'iigt4'),(182,1310005483,'iwillnotgetaddicted','r/comics',0,'Zach Wiener drew an entire Dinosaur Comic for me at Bizarro World in Davis.

As i understand it, consciousness in simply an illusion created by my brain. Humans (and primates) are not instinct-driven and have consciousness, and the ability to make logical choices. \n\nImagine i invented two transportation machines.\n\n1 takes you and genetically sequences and indexes you, sends your genetic code to the receiver and rebuilds you. Your *original* copy would then be destroyed. Basically, this is nothing but genetic cloning, so what would your consciousness be? Would you even have consciousness, or just mere reflexes and instincts? If you did have consciousness, would it be the person from the original copy, or someone who *thinks* that they are because of their past memories (which they may or may not have). \n\n2. This transportation machine creates a model on you based on your Atomic makeup, right down to the most insignificant string and quark. It copies absolutely everything (assuming this is possible, which i know it isn\'t) and sends it to the receiver, then destroys the original. In that instance, would you be you when you got to the other side? In a purely material world, you\'d have to be. There lies the paradox, if you just atomically cloned yourself, would you be in control of both you and your atomic clone? No.\n\n From this experiment, I\'ve come to a remarkable conclusion. Consciousness isn\'t static, its dynamic. Essentially, the brain refreshes consciousness. So, in 30 seconds it could be a new *you*  in control of your body, with exactly the same memories. And how would you know? The new entity would have exactly the same memories. \n\nCan anyone point out where i\'m wrong?',33,68,0,0,'za04n'),(7,1346677306,'rend0ggy','r/AskFeminists',0,'Hi, i\'m a man and i found this pic of Facebook.
